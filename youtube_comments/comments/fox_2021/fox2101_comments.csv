It happened in Sweden. At a summit for food of the future (the climate-ravaged future) called Gastro Summit, in Stockholm on Sept. 3 to 4, a professor held a PowerPoint presentation asserting that we must ‚Äòawaken the idea‚Äô of eating human flesh in the future, as a way of combating the effects of climate change. ‚ÄúIn a talk titled ‚ÄòCan You Imagine Eating Human Flesh?‚Äô, behavioral scientist and marketing strategist Magnus Soderlund from the Stockholm School of Economics argued for the breaking down of ancient taboos against desecrating the human corpse and eating human flesh. He refers to the taboos against it as ‚Äòconservative‚Äô and discusses people‚Äôs resistance to it as a problem that could be overcome, little by little, beginning with persuading people to just taste it.‚Äù"

2021-01-31T01:38:26Z,"@@amanjain4005 healthcare costs in the US have substantially outpaced inflation and wages and since the insurance companies run on a for profit basis, they have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders and despite the care they are required to show patients, that doesn&#39;t extend to ensuring the cost is reasonable. Currently in the US there are precious few mechanisms in place to keep costs in check or for negotiation on those costs. Of all the things that shouldn&#39;t be sold on a for-profit basis, healthcare shouldnt be one of them imo."
