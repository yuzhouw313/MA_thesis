2023-04-10T07:38:56Z,what threatens childrens mental health is the psychopathically evil &quot;adults&quot; who played along with the Live-Action Role-Playing Pandemic That Was Totally Real
2023-04-08T06:16:06Z,"I don‚Äôt know why the children are upset over not hanging out with there friends, they should be thankful because one day their friends will make them do illegal things later in there life."
2022-10-10T20:06:14Z,With or without the pandemic I still don‚Äôt have any friends I started virtual learning half way through 7th grade
2021-12-14T22:16:01Z,Because the media and left have taken GOD and religion out of society! Kids have no respect or faith!  Stop the media!
2021-08-18T02:03:46Z,Trapped.

2021-06-14T04:07:27Z,"The fact that none of these videos have more than 25K views shows we still think of mental health as taboo, even when it comes to our own children. Therein lies the problem"

2021-05-16T03:56:40Z,This is worse than what anyone thought.
2021-05-16T03:53:20Z,The thing is with my scenario is that she wants to make friends and she is not getting that opportunity. This is totally fucked. They are not going to be passed on to the next grade fairly. My daughter cries because she feels alone with no one to talk to. It&#39;s just me and her.
2021-03-26T10:30:48Z,"When I was a kid, the best thing that could happen to me was to be home playing all day alone with no one bothering me. Who likes school?"
2021-03-25T19:27:56Z,The video is very interesting. I read about it in the book &#39;&#39; Mental health issues in the pandemic&#39;&#39; by Arthur Hill and Oswald Howard at Amazon
2021-03-25T09:28:07Z,this bullshit pisses me off its not real its all government controlled for a bigger agenda
2021-02-12T14:11:38Z,Seeing that some of you can&#39;t even handle a year of social isolation tells me most of you were popular/had friends in highschool and it shows. :P

2021-02-23T09:57:03Z,So sorry for you losses. I lost my job and started having panic attacks.  I&#39;m homeschooling my 5 and 7 yr old while working over nights. This year has sucked. My kids are depressed and miss their friends.

2021-01-12T17:16:28Z,We have been dealing with it for 9 months. It called depression and anxiety. It isnt something you can turn on and off or get over in a day.
2020-12-23T05:11:06Z,I have a 12-year-old son and a senior for my 12-year-old it is bad and just getting worse for him mentally
2021-02-23T09:54:49Z,I have a 7 yr old. Same. She says she cries inside ehen she&#39;s sad. She misses her friends. It breaks my heart
2020-12-21T23:37:41Z,So now there is 4 strains of covid 19 because I remember them say months ago that we had 3 strains now they are saying they found another. <br><br>I&#39;m starting to think how much is this is really real and if they are using scare tactics to get people to get the vaccine. <br><br>I for one will not get the vaccine but instead continue to wear my mask and limit who I&#39;m around and keep a healthy lifestyle.
2020-12-12T18:59:21Z,"Stop complying with the orders. Stop allowing you and your kids to be programmed to allow media spread panic to dictate fear. Covid has a 98-99% recovery rate. Far better than most flu strains. And unlike other flu strains, covid has two body counts. Dying direct of covid and dying of anything else but tested for covid post mortem. The panic is artificial, the hospitals and politicians don‚Äôt mind because the larger death count, the more federal funding they receive, and if you‚Äôre invested in pharmaceutical and medical lobbies.... well."
2020-12-11T18:26:50Z,"There is a virus taking over the world, and I‚Äôm not talking about Covid. I‚Äôm talking about the virus of sin. But there is a Vaccine for it! His name is Jesus. Not only that, but He took the piercings for you, to release the healing power which is in His blood. It‚Äôs the cure to depression, anxiety, fear, anger, etc.. Salvation and healing are available for all who receive Him. <br><br>Turn to Jesus and put your trust in Him. Believe in the Gospel: Christ died for your sins, was buried, and rose on the third day so that you would be delivered from the fires of hell and have eternal life in Him. Jesus loves you!"
2020-12-01T09:17:40Z,Add hunger to that and you have a situation where now adults are failing them also.
2020-11-04T13:42:26Z,With my experience working in  an emergency department for 10 years most of the time the issue is the parents. This has been an ongoing crisis. Entitlement is another big problem. Children are spoiled and anytime the parents take the cellphone or computer away the kid automatically goes to &quot;im going to kill myself&quot; then they come straight to the emergency department. Its a revolving door i see some kids everyother month. Some think its a game. The ones that truly need help break my heart. Majority treat it as a joke or bragging rights. Its disturbing
2021-01-12T17:18:25Z,Thats aweful!!!!
2021-07-04T13:50:06Z,I am glad you didn&#39;t lump them all together
2020-11-04T13:36:23Z,Things are hitting a literal crisis point. I work in an emergency department that has its own pediatric wing with 12 emergency department beds and every day i work we have between 3 and 9 children in the emergency department for crisis. Its overwhelming the system. They can be in the ER for anywhere from 2 days to 4 weeks until they find placement in a psychiatric facility. Most get placement from the er some are admitted if they took an overdose and destroyed there liver from a tylenol od etc. Two days ago my hospital had a total of 45 patients both adult and pediatric that were crisis patients. Its burning out the staff. Every crisis patient has to have a 1:1 babysitting the patient 24/7. We are have alot of staff resigning because sitting and staring at a person for 12 hours is burning the staff out. Monday they had to use RNs to be a babysitter because they didn&#39;t have enough staff. Its dangerous pulling all the cnas off every unit for  1:1s when normally the cnas spend the most time with the regular patients so when a patient is acting off they will be the first to catch it. Something needs to happen. Rebuild all the mental hospitals and asylums.
2020-09-28T21:15:05Z,Shame our government didn&#39;t do anything to stop the virus.
2020-09-26T05:55:03Z,Some kids don‚Äôt even have an adult at home through out the day. Mental health is important.
2020-09-26T00:48:03Z,DO YOU REALLY THINK TRUMPET CARES??
2021-01-12T17:26:59Z,"Mre accuratly, do you really think the government in genral cares?"
2020-09-25T15:28:17Z,It took several months before we started thinking about the mental health impacts of the shoot from the hip policies to deal with Covid??? That was simply lazy thinking.

2020-12-09T19:54:53Z,I do all of that. But I can&#39;t be normal. Why do I hit myself from stress? Emotionally breaking down from losing my friends and crush. I scream and cry when I&#39;m alone. I can&#39;t stay up to date with my assignments without crying. I don&#39;t want to leave this world.. I want the missing pieces of my hear back. Now people think I&#39;m weird online.

Kids know nothing about how the government works or about money, or education thats why they are children because they are learning. What child has come to you and has said &quot;hey healthcare is bulls**t&quot; they do not know. Kids grow and know how to play, and learn what parents and teachers teach them. These parents in this article are harassing these kids and nonstop teach them about how bad covid is instead maybe teach them that it will be ok, and help them learn and grow and at the same time stay positive and give them reason to be happy.  I have 5 kids who i have to work 50 to 60 hours a week, teach them at home and still make them breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and at the same time i make some time to take them outside and play with them, or watch a movie or play video games.

2020-09-23T03:39:14Z,Im not saying it‚Äôs easy but the calmer the parents are about this whole pandemic situation the easier I‚Äôll be with the children. Find solutions not the problem. Positive mindset regardless the situation
2021-04-10T00:35:09Z,"Somewhat! Having calm parents doesn&#39;t change the fact that they&#39;ve lost school, lost recreational activities, and other things that they had before this virus. There will still be lots of longterm repercussions from all these restrictions."

Go figure! üò¢<br>I find with my kindergarten and 1st grade grandkids, keeping a normal as possible routine is helpful. Reassuring them things will one day get better helps.

They are ALL sick at heart over current events in one way or another.  Each and every one of them are being ignored to death by the current administration&#39;s complete failure to insist on even the most simple of protections against an aid-borne pandemic - a face-mask.  The United States government did a MUCH better job of identifying and requiring the use of this simple protection from a deadly disease OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO!<br><br>With millions of dollars funneled into politicians&#39; pockets through the 2010 Citizens United decision which enables the ultra-rich to pack their piles of money into off-shored accounts to avoid taxation, the American People don&#39;t seem to have the full attention of our government these days.  If you think this pandemic is bad, don&#39;t EVER think that things can&#39;t get much, much worse.  Ask people &quot;living&quot; in Venezuela.

What is needed are protocols that help detox happen safely and quick. Vit C and D, zinc, silver and different ways to flood you&#39;re body with oxygen without drowning the body in oxygen like a ventilator does.  Just the other day the CDC said they made an &quot;error&quot; in saying the virus can be communicated by air.  This was couple days after they said that a mask was more effect then the next vaccine.  It&#39;s possible the second statement was made truthfully after a lawsuit was started regarding their first statement about the masks preventing contagion."
