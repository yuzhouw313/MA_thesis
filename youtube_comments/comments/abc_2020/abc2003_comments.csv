2020-04-10T13:15:17Z,"Well, As a South Korean I really do not want to say bad things about my country, but you guys probably have realized that what George Orwell had anticipated in his novel, 1984, is becoming a reality here in S.Korea. We have a Big brother Government that tracks down almost every citizen and it has already installed staggering 8 million cctv cameras everywhere. We Koreans are almost forced to pay in credit cards for anything we want to buy[89% of the entire consumption taking place here in S.Korea are paid in credit cards], so that they can monitor every move we make. We are completely kept under surveillance, around the clock, 365 days in a year. if you really think that Koreans are doing better than Americans, it&#39;s because that US media wants you to think that way."

Now US is scrambling as cases continue to rise and there is not enough supplies, masks, technology set in place to fight it. All they can tell us is to social distance and wash hands, state governors are stepping up but the US federal government has the most power to help fight the spread, they could have had many US companies shift their manufacturing to masks, hand sanitizer, alcohol, ventilator, &amp; medical supply as well as put together more advanced tech to track it all. But they didn‚Äôt because Trump is a moron who believe what he feels more than what scientists are tell him.

How do we know that those mask they are sending around the world isn&#39;t lace with some kind of germ ? Really , think about this for a minute. The sleeping giant , ( as they&#39;re are also known ) has awoken and is out to conquer this planet. Them and North Korea little rocket man are in cahoots with this bioweapon and they unleash it against humanity. Look at the bigger picture , it&#39;s a terrorist attack aim at Trump bcoz of the tariffs he impose on them and they are losing billions of dollars every week. So that&#39;s how the Chinese retaliate with this coronavirus."
2020-04-02T11:13:01Z,"In fact, Korea&#39;s Yonsei University Hospital and Korea University Hospital are world-class medical institutions and thousands of foreign patients visit each year. But this high-level medical system is available at low prices because it has actually raised the price of nonessential medical subjects, such as cosmetic surgery and skin, instead of lowering the price of essential medical fields. Medical treatment for beauty purposes is expensive because health insurance is not applied, and large hospitals make up for the loss of cardiothoracic surgery with the proceeds from the treatment."

2020-03-31T17:38:15Z,"Reason Why USA can&#39;t follow the Korean modal:<br><br><br>1.  USA cannot use Cellphone and Credit Card to track people without a Court Warrant, it is in violation of the privacy act.  Korea is mass-tracking population without warrants (no law grant the USA government this power).<br><br>2. Korea is a manufacturing powerhouse, so it can produce PPE, Mask and Ventilators.   USA already outsourced 95% of such &quot;low-tech-low-profit&quot; product else where.  USA simple don&#39;t have trained worker and tooling companies to ramp up production like the Koreans did.  <br><br>3.  Mentality:  Korean experience the SARS and MERS outbreak in the past 20 years, most living people in USA never experienced something like this until the COVID19, people simply isn&#39;t serious."

And all considering that this country is much poorer than others. Seems like Korea and Mongolia well know what to expect from China and know what to do with it."

We trust our goverment Moon president and the government give us an credible information.<br>Second, Korean people are very kind and familyer each other so we care our neghibor, too. For example, if there&#39;s only two toilet papers left(if that is impossble situation in KOREA), although we get them all, we share one to other NOT fighting each other. It is a result of us becoming the most civilized in KOREA. It is too different when we see the situation of our around countries(North KOREA, CHINA!!!!!!!, JAPEN who is press down a mass)<br>Third, we are having a very very good structure of medical system in the world. This is because only the government give people an medical insurance. we only pay at most 5% of a total cost of our medic care.<br>Firth, our doctors and nurses volunteerly care people cost of their exhaust of energy and civil charity help medical people by borrowing a hotel for free and giving them a food and courage. <br>So we confirm we shell get through this virus for few months.

2020-03-30T06:53:06Z,Koreans respect other people much more than Americans.
2020-03-30T06:33:48Z,"I am a Korean, I am proud of myself as a Korean. Now, Korea is very peaceful and can not find any social chaos at all. <br>The infection rate of COVID19   is definitely falling down. Now the recovery rate from corona infection is more increasing than new infection.<br>Total infected people in Korea are 9000 people and recovered people are 5000 people. <br>I want tell you how the infection rate is falling down in Korea is as follows;  <br>1. The most advanced democratic system. <br>  =&gt; Never Korean government have controlled people&#39;s freedom ,  never closed social door. and never closed airport. <br>       Moreover Korean government has been accepting criticisms from many social, public press and people. <br>      the government has never controlled or ignored  their criticisms. According to their criticism, <br>      our government is collecting and correcting  their policy again and again. <br>    <br>       But Korean government is reacting seriously against even one person&#39;s infection and the center for disease<br>      control of Korea is sending  SMS  alert message to each person through Mobile phone  like that infected person <br>       of No.1 or...No.30 COVID was a certain of building, a certain of restaurant or what metro etc. and the authorities<br>      gives final report  that &quot;disinfecting operation is completed and the infected person is now under isolation in a hospital&quot; <br>      and people near by  him or her are under isolation in their house.  If the  people violate the rule related to the self   isolation,  <br>    they get a serious penalty from our government. <br><br><br>2. The most advanced medical system. <br>     =&gt; We pay 3~8% medical insurance depending on incomes from all labor or business as the duty,  <br>        All people who do social activity must pay  medical insurance. So, all Korean people even thought they are rich<br>        or poor gets medical treatment with very very low price. <br>        If we get a cold, we can get the medical treatment in the hospital at less than 5 dollars. and drugs are just one or<br>        two dollars in the pharmacy.<br>        In case of COVID, if someone else get a cold and take diagnosis for that, the person pays USD100 in case of <br>       no COVID infection, however if the person gets infection diagnosis, the USD100 is returned from the public medical<br>       insurance authorities. <br>         However, if the infected  person gets medical treatment in the hospital, the  medical fee is really low  or mostly free <br>       by the public medical insurance. <br><br><br>3. The most advanced citizenship and mobile networking. <br>   I know that panic buying (Hoarding ) is serious in some countries, and saw a  fight by hitting each other <br>   because of a pack of tissue in the supermarket through  youtub and was mostly empty there. <br>   But, absolutely there is no panic buying in Korea, there are a lot of tissues, foods and many life articles in every market <br><br><br>  In stead of increasing price, many supermarkets take discount promotion in stead of increasing price. <br>   Surely there was hoarding case with Mask shortly in Korea, now no more hoarding for the mask under the control of Korean government.<br>   We can buy two pcs at USD 1 every week in the pharmacy in Korea, but nobody tries to buy mask faster and they keeps a line <br>  to wait buying the mask in front of pharmacy. Surely we can buy from 3~4 dollars through internet shopping mall. <br>   if we are not lazy, we can buy  masks without any problem with USD1. <br><br>  Moreover, there  is mobile application to help the people who wants to buy the mask easily and  want to find out a pharmacy <br>  to have stocks.<br>  there are also many mobile application to help buying mask and inform the infected people&#39;s stay in Korea. Never we have a panic<br>   on internet service as well. <br>    Moreover, every elevator in every building , public  toilet and every restaurant furnishes a hand disinfectant . <br>   If you are in Korea, you can  see hand disinfectant every toilet and elevator. in case of myself, i am living a apartment, <br>   and there is a hand disinfectant in the elevator all the time<br>   But nobody steals the hand disinfectant there at all. the disinfectant can be used by everyone as needs <br>   Moreover, we can buy them in the supermarket with cheap price as well.  Never steal anything and never hoarding are happened in Korea. <br>    Korean people are really responsible to every of their duties, for that reason, there are many things to occupy industrial top rank <br>   in the world such as electronics, ships  mechanics and constructions etc in the world. <br>   <br>   One of most proud things which makes me shame also is many volunteers. The city &quot;Dae-Gu&quot; was occupied with 80% infection rate<br>   because of Shinchun-Ji which is a false religion. <br>   Because of this false religion makes saponaceus spread with COVID to all area in SK. About 500 doctors  closed their hospital <br>   and stopped their living activities and went to the city &quot;Daegu&quot; to participate as volunteers and worked for nothing ,<br>   with  the only  intention to help people.<br>   Also thousands nurses also participated as volunteers and cared many infected people even though they work <br>   more than 15 hours in a days without any complaining.  <br>   Moreover, students also are participating as volunteer to provide foods for the infected people by secret without  any invasion of human\<br>   right for the infected people.  <br>  So, Korean people tries to help each other every we have crisis. Moreover,  in another cases was that more than ONE MILLION PEOPLE <br>   worked  and helped as volunteer when a ship have crashed a oil carrier and the beach of the accident area was very serious pollution <br>   from oil spread on the sea. Thanks to million volunteers could recovered sea pollution within 50 days. <br>   Many professionalists said the pollution can be recovered even to 10 years at that time. <br>  <br>   You know that we had a bitter experience from Japan&#39;s colonialism for 45 years, Korean war for 3 years, democratic campaign against <br>military dictators, economic crisis controlled by IMF,  and kicking off our previous president by non violence by keeping public order. <br>Specially when we were suffered from economic crisis &quot;1997~2000&quot; we could escape  very shortly from IMF control <br>by voluntary participation campaign to collect golds. <br>Many Korean people have survived their country to donate their precious gold memorizing their marriage, heritage of their parents etc. <br><br>The most powerful weapon of Korea is not military one, but it is just citizenship of Koreans experienced by many chaotic times.  <br>Korean people are accepting governmental recommendation, surely there is no violation or punishment from Korean government. <br> But Most Korean people are well acting on government guide without any chaos and any criticism, <br>We really respect our Korean government and thanks to them. we love our government to keep the real democratic way.<br><br><br>The three things as mentioned above are the power to control COVID 19 earlier .<br>I want to say that the country can have a long and continuous development with a good citizenship even though a government is stupid. <br>The most important thing to recover this case  is to aware what is citizenship under the democraticism.  <br><br><br>Don&#39;t forget Korean people have kicked off our previous president who had a serious corruptions peacefully without any violation <br>by keeping public order, ie)  cleaning out all street after protest against our previous president. The protest was like a festival. <br><br><br>The three things i mentioned above are the way to recover COVID 19 and they are The Power of Korea."

2020-03-30T05:17:40Z,"I think the anti-Chinese propaganda is what we should expect from Rothschild-controlled media.<br><br>The Coronavirus was engineered at universities in the US (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Yale; and Harvard) and Canada (University of Manitoba). <br><br>&quot;[I]nitial research on the COVID-19 outbreak led nearly immediately to the work of Dr. Ralph Baric. A microbiologist and chemistry professor at the University of North Carolina who had raised the eyebrows and the ire of the immunological community in 2015 by undertaking an unauthorized ‚Äúgain of function‚Äù study for the synthesis of a supercharged SARS coronavirus. Work strictly forbidden by both the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. Both Baric‚Äôs hubris in ignoring a CDC/WHO contravention against gain of function studies and his clear disregard for the consequences of his activities immediately captured instinctual attention as someone whose activities bore closer inspection for potential connection to the Wuhan crisis that is now a global pathogen gaining momentum with each passing day.<br><br>All that was missing was a direct connection between Baric‚Äôs maverick killer coronavirus research and the BSL-4 lab in Wuhan at the (Wuhan Institute for Science and Technology) that serves as China‚Äôs only bioweapons research facility, located in the very city where the COVID-19 pandemic began.&quot;<br><br><a href=""http://www.shadolsonshow.com/2020/01/13/covid-19-born-in-north-carolina-sold-to-wuhan-lab-optimize"">http://www.shadolsonshow.com/2020/01/13/covid-19-born-in-north-carolina-sold-to-wuhan-lab-optimize</a><br><br>While the researchers working in Canada were all Chinese - probably because they were the ones with the most expertise, and often people managing research projects believe that having a common first language is an asset - a few of the researchers were kicked off the research team based on reported suspicions of revealing secrets to people in China. I believe that they were trying to warn people in China what these viruses were designed to do.<br><br>According to Brian Owens (&quot;Mystery surrounds ouster of Chinese researchers from Canadian laboratory&quot;):<br><br>&quot;Canadian researchers are reacting with puzzlement to the news that a ‚Äúpolicy breach‚Äù has caused the nation‚Äôs only high-containment disease laboratory to bar a prominent Chinese Canadian virologist, her biologist husband, and a number of students from the facility.<br><br>On 5 July, officials at the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, Canada, escorted Xiangguo Qiu, biologist Keding Cheng, and an unknown number of her students from the lab and revoked their access rights, according to Canadian media reports. The Public Health Agency of Canada, which operates the lab, confirmed it had referred an ‚Äúadministrative matter‚Äù matter to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, but said it would not provide additional details because of privacy concerns.<br><br>A number of observers have speculated that case involves concerns about the improper transfer of intellectual property to China. (All of the researchers involved are believed to be Asian.) But Frank Plummer, a former scientific director of NML who left in 2015, says the lab isn‚Äôt an obvious target for academic or industrial espionage. ‚ÄúThere is nothing highly secret there, and all the work gets published in the open literature,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what anyone would hope to gain by spying.‚Äù<br><br>The lab works in a wide range of biomedical fields. Qiu is known for helping develop ZMapp, a treatment for Ebola virus that was fast-tracked through development during the 2014‚Äì16 outbreak in West Africa. She has repeatedly been honored for her work on that project, including with a Governor General‚Äôs Innovation Award last year.<br><br>‚ÄúWhile I was there [Qiu] was always highly regarded as a scientist,‚Äù says Plummer, adding that he was ‚Äúshocked and puzzled‚Äù when he heard she was being investigated. ‚ÄúShe maintained connections with China, but as far as I knew she was a regular Canadian scientist.‚Äù<br><br>Cheng, Qiu‚Äôs husband, also worked as a biologist at NML. And both researchers held adjunct faculty positions at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg. It says it has terminated their positions and reassigned their students as a result of the investigation.&quot;<br><br><a href=""https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/07/mystery-surrounds-ouster-chinese-researchers-canadian-laboratory#"">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/07/mystery-surrounds-ouster-chinese-researchers-canadian-laboratory#</a><br><br>-------------------------------<br><br>Since the outbreak the Chinese have reportedly sequenced the virus; so of course they would have the leading technological edge necessary to create the testing kits. It would only be wise for the rest of the world to not ignore the genetic research already performed in China.<br><br>Why are these &quot;yellow&quot; &quot;news outlets&quot; in India giving such an anti-Chinese slant on the story? The most obvious reason would be that China is trying to gain India as an ally in order to fight the &quot;Chinese virus&quot; label that has been foisted on the sheeple - and I believe that the Rothschilds are behind the smears. It could even be that being Chinese was a predetermined qualification for being hired for the research conducted in Canada so they could later propagate the &quot;Chinese are to blame&quot; narrative they wished to tell from the start.<br><br><a href=""https://www.deccanherald.com/international/world-news-politics/china-seeks-india-s-support-to-counter-us-bid-to-lay-covid-19-blame-on-its-door-817288.html"">https://www.deccanherald.com/international/world-news-politics/china-seeks-india-s-support-to-counter-us-bid-to-lay-covid-19-blame-on-its-door-817288.html</a><br><br>Why would the Rothschilds and their globalist friends wish to smear the Chinese? Probably for multiple reasons. <br><br>1) The globalist plan to wipe out much of the population of China has apparently been largely thwarted.<br><br>2) The Western pharmaceutical companies had planned to capitalise on demand for the vaccines that would be sold for hundreds of billions due to the &quot;pandemic&quot;; but the Chinese companies they don&#39;t control have apparently outsmarted them by sequencing the virus before they did and sharing this information with the Koreans, who have apparently formed a strategic economic alliance with China so that they can turn the tables on those which wished to make these economies collapse. In fact, there are no lockdown measures necessary with the approach the Koreans have taken.<br><br>3) The fact that there are examples of countries such as Korea, where no draconian measures are necessary would call into question why (plans for) such draconian &quot;soft martial law&quot; measures are being implemented in much of the rest of the world along with the mobilisation of global military police forces which apparently are being prepared to fight the mass rioting as well as enforce the coming ID2020 system proposed by Bill Gates: of course they would anticipate that many would resist getting a biosensor chip implanted into their bodies.<br><br>4) The Bank of China has been buying up a lot of gold lately. I believe the Rothschilds may have been trying to collapse the Chinese economy so that the Chinese would be forced to sell much of that gold back to the Rothschild banks before the banking systems &quot;reboot&quot; after world economic collapse."

They probably have<br>more infections but know it. Just like in the North East, we thought the<br>infection wasn&#39;t high, UNTIL we get testing moving. If you say go back to work,<br>you could raise the rates of infection and negate the effects of social<br>distancing this harming the people and hampering the containment of the virus.<br>(2) If you look around the world, it takes 3 to 4 weeks for a sick person to<br>recover, we haven&#39;t been infected long enough (and tested) to see and track<br>recovered cases. (3) The ONLY people who need to be at work are the healthcare<br>workers and support services, police, supply chain for food and medical etc.<br>THEY need every PPE they can get so they are protected, PERIOD, the states<br>should not have to ask, the FEDS should deliver ASAP no questions asked, the<br>healthcare system is working OVERTIME to save our lives. (4) If we don&#39;t have<br>the patience (fortitude) to stick to the EASIEST way of defeating the virus<br>(social distancing) then we are idiots. Once the number of infections level off<br>and start to decline ONLY THEN can we project a time to return carefully to<br>work. Looking around the world to see how long that has taken, Chins, S Korea,<br>Iran, Italy, etc. That data will give us the timeline. (4) It is OBVIOUS that<br>social distancing IS the STRONGEST weapon we have to combat this and any other<br>virus. On its own the virus will probably die off in 2 to 3 weeks if it can&#39;t<br>spread to another host (person). (5) Listen to the professional EXPERTS, not<br>politicians or news anchors. This information (REAL) information is what the<br>talking heads should be spreading. (6) Our politicians - leaders should be<br>backing the experts, telling the people what the government can and will do to<br>get the people of the USA through this situation we weren&#39;t prepared for. The<br>CARE ACT IS a very strong attempt to do just that! Be patience, be smart, be<br>calm, don&#39;t be greedy at the food and pharmacy stores. Support each other, we<br>are or should be a team in the crisis. We don&#39;t need BS from anyone, we need a<br>solid real, smart plan to achieve a goal. Citizen of the USA"
2020-03-29T16:21:34Z,I just don&#39;t know why it&#39;s so hard for American people to wear masks.South Korea and many countries already approved wearing masks are helpful.
2020-03-29T16:13:13Z,Asian smart American don&#39;t care

2020-04-05T17:51:10Z,Hurting people is not good. Virus it&#39;s just came so how can we blame to one another or punish them that is so wild. How this Virus infected don&#39;t know.

2020-03-29T15:23:15Z,"The reason Korea is doing well is because they went through SARS and MERS.<br>When 2 people died in MERS, Moon Jae In, the current President, asked then President to apologize.<br>During the MERS, Korea learned a lot, including the necessity of negative pressure room in hospitals and testing kits.<br>We cannot say the current Korean government is doing very well in Korean standard, but they are doing well in world standard."

They upload nice video on YouTube world and keep tell you korea is gooooood.<br>They care only foreigner.  Korean people are suffering and we don&#39;t trust government .only president moon side people are satisfied. we  start protect ourself and help each other  and it gets better.  it is not from government. We have to standing a line whole day for  buying  the mask .therefore young boy died after he lined up in week ago.  The boy had  got a positive results onetime but government want to say it&#39;s not from coronavirus. SO he had to testing 7times for get NOT POSITIVE after he died.  The sad  thing is the boy doesn&#39;t have chance to get treatment until he died.  they don&#39;t support  own people. <br> If you can read korean then please check real korean video. Other than that  you&#39;ll be the one who keep making hero story for korean government. Like china."
2020-03-29T15:15:59Z,It&#39;s not about Korean government. It&#39;s about Korean people.<br>Just be proud to be Korean.
2020-03-29T15:31:12Z,"Well, not everyone in South Korea supports the government since the Korean government has not blocked foreigners&#39; entry. But most of the actions that South Koreans have done so far for fighting Corona19 were very transparent and advanced."

2020-03-29T22:05:17Z,"@@juliotancredi7468 do you really think that panic buying is most important think to  make decision weather success or not from coronavirus?  Soooo funny..That&#39;s just korean personality matter. N.korea always  trying send us missile so we are already educated for that how to control our mind. Like Japanese people learnd how to act when they happen   earthquake.  2nd, do you know that we stop checking korean people for coronavirus testing anymore even you have symptoms. If you have a symptom, you have to take x-ray and show them( which means you have to spend money for atleast $300+ us dollars (in korean money ‚Ç©170(test fee+x-ray fee= approximately ‚Ç©300 plus) but it&#39;s free for foreigner and they just check from the gate. I guess, They stopped testing people because of election is coming( April 16.2020).  3rd,  many people died  similar symptoms like corona  but government says it&#39;s not from coronavirus and they they don&#39;t count.  my question is why so many people are dying at hospital in this time?"
2020-03-29T14:59:19Z,"As a Korean, I&#39;m really proud of my country. <br>However, there&#39;s still a weak point: <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nmgv4kxtcIY"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nmgv4kxtcIY</a><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOFy4x7sBuQ"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOFy4x7sBuQ</a><br><br><br>Some young people are partying in the nightclubs, and some churches are not following the government&#39;s order to stop gathering on Sunday. They&#39;re not taking things seriously. Even I canceled my plan to visit movie theater and arcades. Some people are NOT following simple orders, and they&#39;re being covidiots. The good thing is most of us are following the rules and doing what should we do. These kinds of people are currently being shamed on the internet and media."

2020-03-29T14:27:15Z,"People all around the world ignoring and brushing off the importance of the precautionary measures are either ignorant or misinformed. This is definitely not the right time to stir up ignorance and arrogance. I love and warmly welcome the subtle way Korea manages everything and takes care of their people. Limiting and restricting themselves to the basics, essential and essence of all things. HUMILITY... HUMBLENESS... MODESTY are virtues that many of us have long forgotten! We should all take an example and learn from Asian culture... Covid 19 is not about competitive races or power struggles... this is one and only about humanity that needs to be helped quickly, efficiently and effectively! Regardless of who‚Äôs showing us a way, we should gratefully be inspired and go this way TOGETHER... Because in the end ignorance and arrogance will be the ruin of mankind..."

2020-03-29T13:59:23Z,Being Korean American myself and have been in both countries in past few months I can say Koreans in general are more considerate of others therefore there‚Äôs no issue of panic buying. Also social distancing is more natural for them since people usually only socialize within those close to them. There has always been strict line of ‚Äústrictly business‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. Also they do have great medical welfare system which US is far behind. Their moto is to take care of citizens as opposed to make money off of them.
2020-03-29T13:54:52Z,"Governments, media and docs in US are probably aware about the importance of face masks. They&#39;re not mentioning it as much because people are going to go crazy for buying masks and the supply and demand chain for masks are no where close to cover the whole population of US"

Wearing mask not only stops viruses spread from carrier but also it filter viruses from outside so that protect your lungs from it. That&#39;s the reason why doctors in hospital are wearing mask. Also viruses stick to your hand so wash your hand with soap to kill them if you got outside. I hope you guys are safe by doing it. :D

Our population is about 327.2 million whereas SK is 51.47 million. Our land area is 9,629,091 SqKm and SK is about 100,000 SqKm. We have 50 state government with their own rules and regulations that may be different than those of the federal government. Probably the biggest difference compared to Asia is the US is a very young country and we do not have the wisdom of age like the Asian countries. Compared to most of the world we are young, restless and still trying to find our way to maturity. So please be patient with us because we are still learning."

2020-03-28T12:57:22Z,"I am a Korean. I feel sorry for the current situation in the American people. I hope the U.S. and Europe are not too late to follow Korea&#39;s quarantine policies. The most worrisome fact is that in Korea, socially important people, certified, celebrities, and professional sports players were not exposed to the coronavirus, but in the United States and Europe, socially famous people were exposed to the coronavirus. This means that the U.S. and European governments still haven&#39;t figured out the path of the coronavirus. In Korea, on the other hand, the possibility of socially important people going to places with high risk of exposure to the coronavirus or contacting people infected with the coronavirus is close to zero. This is because the government actively grasped the information of people exposed to the coronavirus. (The reason for 9,000 Korona patients in Korea despite the efforts of the Korean government is that the foolish cult members with the coronavirus lied to the government.) When we talk about Korea&#39;s quarantine system, many people are concerned about whether we can release the personal information of patients with coronavirus to society. There&#39;s actually no answer. What is clear, however, is that many people in Korea support the Korean government&#39;s decision. All we can do is for individuals to give up some freedom for the sake of the vast majority of safety, while at the same time society gives thanks and encouragement to individuals infected with the coronavirus. Whether this policy is an infringement or a concession depends solely on the thinking of those who look at the matter. someone might think that Koreans follow national policies well because they still don&#39;t know the importance of freedom and individual human rights. But if you knew that Korea was the only country in Asia that established a democratic government through &#39;reform from below&#39;, you wouldn&#39;t say that.

Now our mask manufacturing ability is supporting this mask support for citizens during Corona ourbreak...so yeah...this is funny how we got prepared because of China from the virus coming from China.ü§®"

So to protect our neighbors and family.. ppl have to stop thinking that  someone who wears a mask is kinda patient. Hope to stay healthy for all of Us ppl..
2020-03-27T14:39:56Z,"@MkNitara yeah me as well... i am in states too.  So i decided to make the mask.. i am gonna try. Cuz in Korea they also have the same issue &quot;out of stock&quot;. If they want to buy they must have thier ID, and allow them to buy only few for each person. So they started to make it and wear  it. Lots of ppl wear the mask which called &quot;Handmade&quot; :)."
2020-03-28T02:13:17Z,@MkNitara Cloth masks or handkerchiefs. There are instructions online how to make the former. Use multiple handkerchiefs at the same if you choose the latter. You want distance between the cloth touching your mouth and the cloth touching the air.
2020-03-27T06:12:15Z,"See I told you guys to wear mask even if you are not sick. It prevents your dirty bodily fluids or particles from spreading everywhere. And some people were saying noooooooo, don‚Äôt wear mask, and were running away from me when I wore mask like I am some kind of sick person. Idiots."
2020-03-27T06:06:31Z,"Koreans wear masks because of the air pollution they have until now, not just because of the virus . that&#39;s the reason why they have these massive skincare products because the air can make you look 2x old."

So almost all Koreans can buy masks without hoarding them. What&#39;s important is that healthy Koreans buy their own masks (purchased) and low income earners or senior citizens. It is to give way to the medical team. Make, use, and donate at home. Korean people pick up all the trash after the rally. Corona goes to Daegu to volunteer.

2020-03-27T03:29:43Z,"Unknown infectious Diseases are everywhere happening everyday in the world you never know when it happens around you (new diseases are always developing new forms unknown to human in the beginning anytime anywhere) !!!! Such as the one &quot;H1N1 virus&quot; happened in USA , ignorant by all americans in the beginning in 2009, having killed 284500 people in USA, Canada &amp; all over the world.  However, Very much surprised and weird that the West inclined to get excited and like to report in a very high profile when problems concerning other countries &quot;natural challenges&quot; such as this one happening in China now.<br><br><br>Now this time more and more Flu patients have been discovered to be Covid19 patients after more Covid 19 tests are conducted on these Flu patients in USA and Europe and other parts of the world.<br><br><br>Then recently just since Last year &quot;s Flu season, more than 10000000 infected (In USA, most doctors never conducted Coronavirus Test for patients infected with Flu because patients are needed to pay thousands of dollars) while 5000 people died of Flu / pneumonia related diseases in USA alone (probably some of these deaths are caused by Covid19). More than 100 thousands people (particularly old people) died in other countries in the West (all over whole Europe, particularly Italy, France, Germany, Iran, Korea, Japan ) or in the world for Pneumonia infectious related diseases, but west media reported such diseases or sickness in a very low profile.<br><br><br><br><br><br>This is simply just a new type of Pneumonia (ie. Caused by so called corona virus) recently discovered in China, so no strange and be calm and have confidence on the highly efficiently mobilized and action centralised Chinese Government which have great knowledge and experience able to handle such natural challenges of New Pneumonia (Corona virus) in a really professional way like other similar incidents happened before internationally. Such as China &quot;s ability to mobilize all Chinese citizens, medical staff from the military, all civil servants and etc to fight against this virus invasion in the way to fight against foreign invasion wars of any kinds.<br><br><br><br>In fact, though it might be a little unfortunate for China, yet it can give a good chance for China to have a full practical national training in fighting against a war similar to biological terrorism attacks from China &quot;s hostile Super opponents. Salute to those medical professionals and other people in other sectors work together in China and other parts or the world to fight against this natural challenges and they can overcome all difficulties facing them. After overcoming this new natural challenges again, I would believe that China would have great confidence to become the most sophisticated nation in handling all kinds of new developing infectious diseases happening all over the world everyday.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Cheer to all Chinese people and their outstandingly centralized Govt having stood calm, then with immediate remedial actions taken since the outbreak of these new discovered virus !!! Just 16 years ago, the Chinese Govt united together with all their 1.4 billions patriotic citizens had overcome the SARS challenges very well, this time for sure they can handle this Less Critical natural challenges. Let us just pray for those who have suffered from this New Pneumonia and try to help each other to prevent from any kinds of diseases happened in any countries in the world !!!   <br><br><br><br>Every country has a chance (maybe next turn is your country) to have new kinds of diseases infected and spreading around the world, so never complain others but show your help if you so wish or just show your sympathy by heart if you are busy instead of spreading rumors against a country which is now nationally busy in taking the natural challenges !!!! Let us pray if you are Christian !!! Amen !!!"

2020-03-26T21:48:21Z,I think Japan is even more impressive than South Korea. Japan has a flat growth rate of the virus and Japan is not even doing anything! Life goes on as usual in Japan. There are no mass testing of people. The difference is that the Japanese people wear mask to prevent infecting the other people even before coronavirus came. Anyone who feels sick automatically wear mask. Everyone does it so the spread of the virus has been minimized in Japan even without government intervention. That is impressive.
2020-03-27T10:02:24Z,@@user-94avsf-smdk26 I don&#39;t think so. The Japanese are wearing face masks more than the South Koreans. That is already in their culture.

2020-03-28T13:52:35Z,"I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s about supply and demand (Economics 101). In South Korea, they already wear masks quite a bit because of pollution and some wear it for fashion as well. Masks are a norm so there was already a market with people willing to buy it, so they&#39;ll already have more masks. In America, very few people wore masks before the outbreak. Few people wanted them so there were few in stock to be sold. Also, it&#39;s about the response to the pandemic. In America, many downplayed the virus in the early stages and didn&#39;t stock up on masks or testing kits. Therefore, once Americans started needing masks, there already was a shortage. South Korea was prepared before the worst of the pandemic hit and were able to flatten the curve while the US is trying to catch up as it gets worse."

Hong Kong and Taiwan, which blocked themselves from spreading from the scratch, are of course terrific. However, from the very nature of covid 19, it&#39;s very difficult to block all the possibilities of infection. In that sense, we can say the goddess of good fortune smiled to the people living in the above areas. In the early stage, S.Korea also took the same path. Unfortunately, however, there happened to arise massive secondary surges in Korea. In fact, such emergence could be said so natural in a populated country like South Korea. Any way, Korea is successfully coping with this secondary surge. That&#39;s why Korea is praised as truly great. They are turning out to be successful conquers who control over that bad turning point BEYOND GOOD LUCK.  Yes. They are truly qualified to be called the model of the world."

The president, Jae-In Moon, didn&#39;t obstruct people from China entering Korea at all, because not only him but also the government people thought that the policy would lower their image from China and related countries. Also he encouraged people to say the name&#39;corona virus&#39;, not &#39;Uh wan(Chinese) virus&#39;. The greed of the government people in our country really played a big role of the spreading of the corona virus.

2020-03-26T11:59:22Z,"One lesson to all westerners: wear mask in public 100% all the time! Look at China&#39;s 31 other Provinces, Singapore, Japan, S. Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, etc., very near to the epicenter of the outbreak with high tourism travels between countries and yet the virus spread is controlled and not that high compared to the West. Climate and humidity are not the big factor as Beijing, S. Korea among other regions is also colder like the west BUT the common denominator is:<br>- public wearing of masks<br><br>This covid-19 is a respiratory disease and primarily transmitted via respiratory droplets and saliva. Everytime a person speaks fine saliva droplets are ejected, nevermind sneezing and coughing. An asymptomatic person unknowingly spreads the virus this way, by just mere talking inside subway, elevator, bus, airplane, close rooms, etc. Those droplets can be inhaled or ingested by unsuspecting person closeby. Another route is when those droplets land on surfaces such as handles, food items, packaging, tables, etc. Unsuspecting person can catch that virus via direct contact on contaminated surfaces. Westerners are taught washing of hands is more important to prevent catching the virus. However, wearing mask is a good preventive measure from catching the virus through inhalation or ingestion. It also prevents the ejection of the virus from the mouth (saliva droplets) in asymptomatic and infected person. It also prevents someone from unnecessarily touching the nose and mouth from unwashed hands in public. People normally touch their faces subconsciously."

2020-03-26T08:57:53Z,"If you are in a sparse area, without mask still ok. Afterall you&#39;d need a lot of masks if this epidemic is gonna last a few mths. However, if you are in overcrowded within 2 m of each other, then it makes sense to put on a mask because either yourself or the person next to you is asymptomatic and you didn&#39;t know, neither does that person. I think in East Asia, people are already wearing them even in normal situation when they are sick or against pollution would just find it a normal extension of their lives but in western countries, it&#39;d take a lot of convincing, as you can see even enforcers like police officers aren&#39;t wearing. That explains the flattening out of the curve in the east asian countries, other than rapid testing, contact tracing by using their advanced technology, and isolation/quarantine of people away from their population. This is played out in S Korea, Taiwan, HK and Singapore. What they are facing now is a possible 2nd wave - imported infection from people coming back from the USA and Europe. This may also be played out in USA/Europe after your long battle with the 1st wave, depending on how whether this pandemic is contained in most countries by then."

2020-03-26T07:58:47Z,"Misinfo in this report here. Mass testing? it was only done in specific areas where the virus spread. Non near the areas I lived (though there is a separate line to call if you had any symptoms of the virus, you are told NOT to visit any local hospitals in case of infecting others and use the call line instead for separate testing). Masks are in limited supply and Korean govt got a lot of heat because they sent millions to China while the people here didn&#39;t have enough (produce 10m a day while pop is 50m+). And because there weren&#39;t enough to go around, the Govt is now backtracking from telling the public originally of replace the mask once per day to once every few days (Why not show the ppl waiting in line trying to buy masks? it was all over the news in KR, though subsided now). There are alerts via SMS but only after the person infected is confirmed and txts out the locations of where he/she has been. The only spike happened in Daegu (southside of Korea) due to the stupid  mass gatherings in a cult-like church. People are well educated enough about wearing masks even when there isn&#39;t a virus going around because of all the god damn smog coming from China. Koreans are mad because the govt didn&#39;t close immigration/visitations from China when the crisis started, Trump took swift action on that at least. Panic buying happened in specific areas, but it was mainly masks not water. Most people in Korea has a private water filtration system in their homes + bidets (it&#39;s 2020 people, why would you wipe your own ass and get shitstains when you can use water pumped up there to clean it instead)"

Tesing is really important because chances of virus spread is much higher at initial stage and non crital symptoms. Here in US, insurance company think of money only and so many people do not have insurance. So hard to get tested even."

If we all have minimal altruism and community spirit, we can keep our freedom with minimal control. And keep in mind that your uncontrolled freedoms can harm others. If you are infected with a virus, inform your neighbors of your route. The information you provided will be of great help to your neighbors.

Even if it is 20% additive protection on top of hand cleaning.  Anything is better.  I tell them what is the point of all the toilet paper and water you hoard if you go around taking dumb risks.

I think everyone should wear masks esp going to restock on grocery shopping, or getting takeout food, get gas for the car.  Use sanitizer or bring soapy water in a spray bottle if you got no sanitizer or alcohol pads.  disinfect/wash your mask esp cloth after every use even if only 10 minutes out before you reuse it."

2020-03-25T17:49:06Z,Wear a mask as much as you can.<br>Wear a cotton mask or something. Better than not wearing a mask.<br>Covid-19 is a respiratory infection. You have to wear a mask more and more.<br>- from South Korea
2020-03-25T17:35:05Z,It‚Äôs pretty obvious! Government here don‚Äôt want to invest money for PPE or mask because it‚Äôs a lot of money and they want that money on there own pocket.

2020-03-25T16:50:33Z,Why wouldn&#39;t CDC recommend people to put on masks everyday?  They say to wear it only if you believe you have signs of Corona virus.  Wouldn&#39;t it be better to be precautious by wearing the mask before you get infected from others or to spread?  CDC just don&#39;t want the society to panic.  But average people need to protect themselves before it happens.  Washing hands is good but putting a mask on is MUST.

2020-03-25T12:19:49Z,"Please wear a mask!!! It can save you and your families! If you don&#39;t have any masks, you make it through youtube."
2020-03-25T12:05:14Z,See whats the difference!! PLEASE WEAR A MASK WHEREVER YOU GO!! Virus is in the air!!
2020-03-25T11:38:59Z,"In Korea, mask are used to protect themselves, as there are possibilities if the infected person meet with other people without knowing he or she was infected. However, in Western countries including U.S., it seems that people have a strong sense of negative view of people wearing masks, because they think the people wearing masks are sick. <br>As a Korean, I think you should change your perception of people wearing masks. Wearing masks is not only for sick people. It should be also used to protect yourselves."
2020-03-25T11:34:56Z,"Until last week, we were crazy at buying masks (which you can buy two piece for every week with your id card in pharmacy) like it‚Äôs the only way to protect yourself from infection and respectful to people around you, Now most of the people have enough masks that there are only 5-6 people in front of the pharmacy waiting for their turn. I know in many other cultures, the perception about the people whose wearing a mask is not positive, but you guys should know it‚Äôs The most important way to protect yourself and people of your country. There was one case in Korea at the beginning who confirmed Corona Virus after visiting China, this guy wore a mask all the time even inside if his house when he was with his family and relatives, No one was infected thanks to his efforts of protection. We know it‚Äôs super inconvenient to breathe, smelly, hard to talk and communicate with people, but it made Koreans and their community to be safer. Plz wear mask, if it‚Äôs hard to buy, make one by your own. I wish all the other countries to be safe and healthy."
2020-03-25T11:25:04Z,"Here in philippines the whole nation is in lockdown and everybody must wear a mask when you go outside. Stores wont let you in if you dont have and if police see you outside without mask they will arrest you. And also we have nationwide curfew, but even in the morning very few people go outside."
2020-03-25T11:23:00Z,"I wore a mask when I visited Target last week in NY. People treated me as if I was a patient. People, we need to be able to change our perspective of wearing masks."
2020-03-28T08:49:22Z,"Actually, here in the west So Cal, I noticed many non-Asian people wearing masks too, esp the elderly people. It&#39;s a good sign."
2020-03-25T11:12:01Z,"Bruce Lee is alive, doing karate on the virus."
2020-03-25T10:46:17Z,"It&#39;s kinda too late for the USA now. And let&#39;s be serious. If this was China, you&#39;d be talking about how the government would be using this to track people and controls them even more. This is some kind of an attack against private life."
2020-03-25T10:41:41Z,Wear a mask. It works. There&#39;s no confinement in Korea because everyone is wearing mask. You can go anywhere and meet anyone without fearing to get infected as long as you&#39;re wearing mask. If it&#39;s impossible to get a mask in your country try to find a substitute and at least try to cover your mouth and nose. Infection is all about the chances and you have to try your best to lower the chances.
2020-03-27T22:08:32Z,The moment someone touches that mask he or she is going to be infected. Also mask dont last more than a few hours. The real deal is being able to track the infected. The masks are just a plus.
2020-03-28T00:21:15Z,@@bemersonbakebarmen <br>There have been no studies about how effective the mask is but we know by experience. Patients who were wearig mask all the time didn&#39;t infect anyone maybe except their family members  but patients who were not wearing mask spreaded the virus to everyone. Korea has been aggressively tracting down the patients so we can trust this experience.
2020-03-25T10:35:19Z,"I am korean.<br>1.Government quick response and transparency.<br>2.Excellent inspection system.<br>3.Keep away from others and wear a mask~!"
2020-03-25T10:30:15Z,"Government went &quot;fast&#39; and &quot;transparent.&quot;<br>1. KCDC has been holding a daily briefing to the entire country releasing ALL details as they are.<br>2. They tested everyone linked to each case, tracking down their movements.<br>3. It separated patients immediately into isolation - depending on the severity, a patient was sent to either &quot;community treatment center&quot; or a hospital.<br>4. People are pretty good at working together in a time of crisis: this has to do with the modern history of having dealt with invasions and wars. <br>Even politicians showed bipartisan efforts compared to other countries.<br>5. The medical kits have been well developed due to recent similar outbreaks of MERS and SARS.<br>I am not usually proud of my country, but, on this one.. gotta give credits to it."
2020-03-25T10:26:23Z,"tracking people is against democracy, against freedom and against human right.  USA should free SOUTH KOREA."
2020-03-25T09:52:46Z,I just want the entire world to get through this crisis to be peaceful again. Now I see how peaceful it was and gifted it was to live in such world with no Covid 19. I used to love traveling abroad but I can‚Äôt do that anymore sadly :(
2020-03-25T09:30:49Z,Govt was proactive about problematic area (hot zone) fast. With the help of test kits they isolated covid 19 positive patients. Also citizens took precautious steps by wearing masks. Smart phone alerts about where covid 19 patients were were also helpful.
2020-03-25T09:25:43Z,Yeah trump wanted this but was made a mockery of by the media.

2020-03-25T08:58:45Z,"The Korean government&#39;s Moon Jae-in has predicted that this situation will come and has been preparing since 2017. They already have a lot of data.

They use every possible method to get the track of the confirmed cases - location of the phone, private contacts, credit card records, etc. - just like a BIG BROTHER and NO PRIVACY AT ALL. No wonder why they are extremely cautious not to get caught. Also, no wonder why it cannot be implemented in the liberal western countries."

2020-03-25T06:26:49Z,"Koreans are all donating voluntarily to help people in situations that are harder than I am. Food and masks are donated for the medical staff. And if the condition is not critical even if you have corona, you voluntarily go to an isolation facility to have someone who is sicker than me get treatment first. That is the reason for not causing medical panic and the death rate is lower than that of Italy or China. <br>Koreans have done so historically. Many people voluntarily sacrificed their lives to return my country&#39;s name to the people when it was ruled by Japan. They didn&#39;t want any reward, and there was a Korean flag in their hearts.<br>When my grandmother was young, she saw a seven-year-old child being shot by a Japanese being for using Korean. Koreans have always prepared to defend their country at the expense of my life in times of war.<br>And <br>when I saw foreigners without masks, I thought it would be harder to buy masks than Koreans, so I gave him my mask <br>Korea&#39;s founding ideology is &quot;Help Human to the Far Away.&quot;<br>This means constantly trying to help others."

You know what here in the States mask are sold out of any hardware store in the U.S they dont sell N95 mask. They prioritize is in the frontliner who works at the Hospital is there priorities.<br>How about a Living Person walking in the street with no mask in his mouth? Its look like you are widely invited the Covid19 into your nose and mouth. A lot of people here did not wear N95 mask they are relaxing walking in the street. Enjoy shopping with a huge Crowd at Walmart panicking and Hoarding tissue papers and rolls of paper towels. Smart Country wears mask asap to prevent the Spread of Covid19 wear mask all the time! I hope you guys will catching up the main point to stop the Spread.

If people cooperated with quarantines we could have at least made some better progress regardless of how big the country is, we have state governments as well. You might think you have so much freedom now and that it&#39;s a good thing, but the government is corrupt and this &quot;freedom&quot; is going to cause us to pay big time. New York is already showing overcrowded hospitals and doctors have to make unethical choices to just let some people die so they can treat others. You think that&#39;s good? We don&#39;t even have universal healthcare. Some kid DIED of the virus because he didn&#39;t have insurance. This doesn&#39;t even seem like a first world country anymore."

2020-03-29T15:21:57Z,"@NewtNukem Wow, so much nonsense. Speaking of freedom, South Korea NEVER issued Shelter-in-place or lockdown order of entire city or region or contain this virus. So much for freedom, huh! <br><br>It was all about preparedness. This administration only cared about restricting travelers from certain hot spot nations without bothering to preparing - test kits, masks, ventilators... for inevitable spread within its border."
2020-03-30T07:28:52Z,"NewtNukem Yea, that freedom you have is so strong that people don‚Äôt listen to their government and refuse to have social distance. Which will lead to kill so many innocent people. That‚Äôs good that you have that freedom. Good for you."

2020-03-24T23:41:19Z,"I have been living in states for over 20 years and I also lived 18 years in South Korea. What really comes down to is the following ; 1. People wear masks in South Korea and we should too. It reduces  risk of getting other people sick. We are not advising people to wear masks because we are short in supply. Right now, we need them primarily for health care professionals. 2. The South Korean healthcare system is run by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and is free to all citizens at the point of delivery. The system is funded by a compulsory National Health Insurance Scheme that covers 97% of the population. So if they want to get tested, they will get it. This is an important factor,  We need to identify problem areas and that can only be determined by testing as many people as possible. Again, we are not advising people to take test unless they have symptoms. Our healthcare system may not be capable of handling all confirmed patients, especially at this growing rate and at this stage. Overall, we are doing our best but I just want to point out that our healthcare system isn&#39;t designed to follow the same path."

2020-03-24T23:31:56Z,In Asia during the flu seasons they wear mask all the time. So they are used to it. In America u wear mask they say your sick. Mask helps you not touch your face and your nose. Incase people who are coughing the mask helps you not to catch the cough.

2020-03-24T22:24:54Z,"Also NO ONE in South Korea is panic buying. There is no long line in front of supermarkets and no one is hoarding anything.

2020-03-24T22:22:53Z,"First thing first. So Korea has socialized healthcare, with free testing for all.  Those tested positive were isolated and treated.  Meantime, everyone wears masks to everywhere, and everywhere is constantly sanitized.  On the flip side in the USA, testing is limited and not free.  Everyone is to stay at home and hope of not being infected.  Should you get l sick, you are not to congest the healthcare facility, and possibly contaminate others, so you are to phone your doctor for advice.  Your doctor will determine whether you will be seen and if you are  qualify to be tested.  Should you be tested and found to be positive, and the cost of treatment will be determine by what type of insurance you have, and should you have no insurance, be prepare to get a bill for the treatment cost."

2020-03-24T22:03:20Z,"Bad math.  Relevant number would be cases per million population.  Much closer rates,   US has 6.5 times as many population but only 5 times the cases, of S Korea.

The handles, buttons and other things handled the most by the public, the ones that are most likely enabling the virus to spread to the most people, would be the most inhospitable for the virus to live. Because all the bleach left on there by all those people would be killing its ability to survive and spread considerably, so much so that the figures of new cases would most likely drop to barely any at all.<br><br>And this is such a simple thing that could be so effective. I already emailed several newspapers and tv news about this but they&#39;ve not mentioned it once, it seems they&#39;re more interested in scaring people as much as possible. Instead of fearmongering and telling everyone to hide away at home like scared little sheep totally reliant on their &#39;shepards&#39; for protection and guidance, they should be telling everybody to do this simple but effective idea. Everyday printing it and showing it on tv. So people can get on with their lives and all of us together can do our own little bit towards fighting this virus as a community. Working strongly together instead of dividing us up and hiding us away like scared little rabbits while this virus just continues to spread through all the millions of buttons and handles around the world.<br><br>I&#39;m sure you know that one person with this virus only has to cough into his hand just before opening a door or pressing a button or something, and then the next five or ten people that come after him will most likely come down with it too, or at least they will go and spread it to anything else they touch afterwards. The people of the world are your best soldiers to fight this. Please just do whatever you can to help me recruit them all, and lets see the end of this disease sooner rather than later. Before one of yours or my family becomes one of the next victims. Please tell everyone you can, and tell them to tell everyone, and tell them to tell everyone to tell everyone. Lets get this simple idea going now before its too late. The governments could even put refill stations in busy areas like shopping centres and train stations etc.<br><br>Thank you and good luck in these trying times.&quot;<br><br>===============================================<br>-Remember guys, Man is the apex predator, Man is the most dangerous living organism this planet has ever seen. We kill way more than any other animal, bacteria or disease has ever done. But we need to start acting like it if we are going to beat this thing. Not hide away scared.<br><br>Simple solutions are often the most effective. so get yourself some bleach or disinfectant solution and get out there and do your bit. its your duty as a human being really.<br>And share this now like you&#39;ve never shared anything in your life, because your life, and many others especially the old and your children, may depend on it.<br><br>SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE NOW.<br><br><br>Please if you speak another language translate and share to help protect your country."

It is a country with high technology. US cant test, track, and treat like South Korea does with its current system. Also South Korea has one of the best healthcare systems in the world and all the test and treatmemt is all FREE to their citizens. Americans are more afraid of medical bills than getting infected with coronsvirus. That is reality of US"
2020-03-27T11:05:41Z,"koyukiny : Valid Point. South Korea is well advanced among nations. Attributed not just to their govt, but the personal responsibility of the people. I am simply saying that the scale and scope of our issue is dramatically different to what South Korea was dealing with."
2020-03-24T21:25:05Z,"What S.Korea have been doing is a test and quarantine,  track down all possible exposed people and test them all! Also, the government clearly open all the information showing how many test had been conducted, number of confirmed people, mortality rate, as well as where the covid 19 infected person had been visited. Which is not happening in the US."
2020-03-24T21:21:34Z,"What this news report is missing: South Korea is failing on social distancing. Coffee places are crowded, and some of the concert halls had 1,000 attendees, just a few days ago. With infected people flowing in from abroad, their numbers will spike again if they do not enforce strict social distancing now. Yes, stay-at-home orders do cause inconveniences and financial difficulties, but I feel much safer where everyone is required (not simply encouraged as in South Korea) to stay at home."

If everybody covers the mouth and nose the virus will have no way to come out the mouths and noses. China, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan they are all successful in containing the virus . They used different tactics but one thing in common is that everybody wears masks in their countries . Everybody Wearing masks is the main reason for their success."

2020-03-24T21:04:04Z,THE reason they took measures to counter it so fast is because they are RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE THE OUTBREAK STARTED. Of course you are going to act  when you are right by where it all broke out.

That made us learned about disease spreading among people. And that is why we are just more serious in participating social distancing, wearing masks, and following guidelines.

2020-03-24T20:46:11Z,Not a huge fan of the whole government tracking your movements thing. Its very important to not equally compare countries like S. Korea and the US. Our population is much larger and our land mass is much much larger. We are very spread out. The main issue in the states is the availability of test kits. Our private companies are now producing more masks and ventilators so hopefully scarcity of those wont be an issue.

Actually I know it&#39;s hard to get masks because there&#39;s no manufacturing in the U.S. or Europe. Then make a cotton mask at home using your old clothes!! Although it is less effective than n95 (kf 94), it can prevent the other person&#39;s saliva. Don&#39;t look at Asians wearing masks with an abhorrent look, please make a mask and use it. And you can make and use hand sanitizer. Medical alcohol and aloe gel. It&#39;s simple. All the instructions are on YouTube, so please. The start of each small prevention can prevent the health of your country&#39;s people and prevent infection from spreading. Make sure you don&#39;t go out unnecessary.

2020-03-28T03:10:30Z,"slifer 4195 Because Taiwan made a decision to ban the travellers from China before the coronavirus becomes pandemic, they took action quicker than all of the other countries.  They are the only place to take action to prevent the coronavirus before it became pandemic, unlike all other countries took action after it became pandemic including South Korea, Japan and all western countries."

I understand we don&#39;t really have enough masks here so we need to start making them. Also stop telling people only people should wear masks are those who got the virus or have symptoms, we got to make everyone wear them so it doesn&#39;t spread. Lot of times Coronavirus don&#39;t even have symptoms so this is another reason why everyone need to wear them."

Don&#39;t you guys think that wearing a face mask protects us better than isolating ourselves at home?"
2020-03-24T17:18:35Z,"Perhaps South Koreans have more reasons to trust their government than we do ours.  We are suspicious of our government for many reasons, but partly because we know we elect ineptitude.  At every level, not just the Federal level."

This is how the mask market is now in Korea.<br><br>In conclusion, wearing a mask is one of the fundamental ways to solve this situation.¬†Thank you for reading.

Yeah, we have our fair share of idiots who still hold large church group ceremonies or hang out at clubs on Fridays, since our government did not prohibit such activites. Yet, here now in SK, some local governments are now issuing orders to prohibit such clustering of people at their(local government&#39;s) own discretion. These orders are not by the central government. It means we do not try to limit people&#39;s freedom unless we have exhausted other measures first."

2020-03-24T15:59:32Z,The thing is that South Koreans are still struggling with wrong strategies by government. Masks are hard to get. They have to be in a long line to get 2 masks. The reality appears to be different. The one thing that made South Korea strong is that Koreans cooperate and self-isolate themselves to overcome this as a society while Americans tend to behave more individualistically.
2020-03-24T18:00:37Z,every country is short of masks these days  you idiot. what can the government do when all the people want them at the same time? I heard that many people in Korea are grateful for what the government has been doing.
2020-03-24T18:33:46Z,@P S many other countries are praising your country now for what your government has been done and you are not satisfied?? you guys should be grateful at least for this corona situation. just look at other countries. which one is doing better?
2020-03-24T21:27:51Z,"@@todono33 You dont know what is going on in Korea. Korean people know its situation better than any others. Americans criticize American gov because you know better. Koreans know their gov better tha  any other. We dont criticize Itian gove because wd dont know them. We dont to English,  neither to Peru, nor to Mongolia because we dont know them. you only know them thru media, a part of it not really true."

2020-03-24T15:56:25Z,The US has not had a culture of wearing masks like Asian country&#39;s so yes they already had masks at home unlike here were you would have been laughed at for wearing one. Also Obama was the one that dropped the ball  and cut funding for national preparedness. One more thing South Korea 80 million people US 320 million that would have had a fit at first if told to stay home. Thankfully we catch  on fast and are getting up to speed very quickly.
2020-03-24T15:56:02Z,"Testing,testing,&amp; more testing needs to be done or else you cant identify who has or carries this virus..."
2020-03-24T15:55:29Z,It&#39;s amazing how people actually think that America can mimic what smaller less populated and more authoritarian countries can accomplish. People will throw their rights away for the illusion of safety in a heartbeat.
2020-03-24T15:55:18Z,"In our country, it is taboo to wear a mask - the opposite of what we should be doing!! Jez!!"

2020-03-24T15:52:15Z,South Korea is testing everyone whether they have symptoms or not.. the US is very selective in testing and that‚Äôs why the cases are only increasing

Gov is injecting fear!&quot;*<br><br>These two opinions coexisted on the same newspaper.

2020-03-24T15:47:55Z,You have to remember how south Korea tracked all their people like that isn&#39;t even legal here. Also their mask supply is a LOT more abundant due to cultural differences between us and them. If you watch them in day to day life a significant portion of the population wear masks no matter what really.
2020-03-25T02:00:42Z,Light Yagami they don‚Äôt track all their people. That‚Äôs not legal there either. They only get their cell phone location history for those who tested positive so that they know where these people have been to go target deep cleaning and sanitization and to let the public know not to go near those areas or warn them of possible exposure to the virus.

2020-03-24T15:41:24Z,How about all the sanitizing they did in the streets and on public transportation? I&#39;m sure that helped in the slowing down of spread.  These are the same people who lived through SARS a few years back and learned a little something about controlling a contagion.

As far as I know, Maxist politicians and governments don&#39;t disclose important information to the people. I heard that the U.S. is not open to the public and the opportunity to be tested is difficult. So the U.S. government is a Maximist?"

2020-03-24T15:17:57Z,"South Korean version of CDC who prepared all these by simulating possible outbreak like Corona virus was established by an order of former president Roh mu hyun who was a life long partner and friend of current president Moon Jaein. Do you remember a ferry boarded more than 300 students was sunken in 2014? The patrol who got there first didn&#39;t order leaving the ship because they were busy with reporting the situation to the president who now impeached and in prison Park Geun  Hye, which resulted most of students drowned to death. It&#39;s all about who has been leading the country and prepared system. I&#39;m pretty sure the situation in here SKorea would&#39;ve been not much different or worse than other countries if there weren&#39;t presidents like Roh and Moon. It&#39;s all about politics.

The fusion of the Coronavirus occurs at a higher acidity level. So, it appears that it&#39;s important not to eat foods high in sugars, and caffeine, as they raise your acidity levels. Drinking at least 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda (a 0.1 molar solution of baking soda has a pH of about 8.3) mixed with 1 tablespoon of water (or the least amount required for the baking soda to completely dissolve in the water), and lime or lemon juice (from 1 lime or lemon which both have a ph of about 3), will help prevent Coronavirus fusion during the incubation period, thus will greatly reduce any symptoms, and speed up recovery time. Mix 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda with one tbsp (or as little as possible to ensure the baking soda dissolves) of distilled water in a glass. Mix the juice from one lime or lemon in a seperate glass, also with 1 tbsp of water (or the least amount required for the baking soda to fully dissolve in the water). Once the baking soda has dissolved, and the solution is clear, drink it. Then immediately drink the lime or lemon juice solution. A reaction will occur that kills any viruses, and even any bacteria, located in your throat. Of course, internally, you will have an alkaline pH, as opposed to an acidic pH, preventing Coronavirus Cell-fusion. This is why we do not want to overly dilute the solution with water. This mixture has been proven to lower fever, stop nasal secretions, and mucus development in the lungs, as well as treating other symptoms. This will not prevent you from contracting the coronavirus. But this will disallow the coronavirus to have an optimal acidic base, which allows Coronavirus-cell fusion. So, besides taking at least 1000 mg. vitamin C everyday, take this solution. In laments terms, The Coronavirus-cell fusion does not occur at a neutral pH. Fusion activation is a direct low ph dependent process occuring with a half maximal rate of fusion at pH 5.5. Of course, they aren&#39;t telling anyone this. As a matter of fact, Reuters is claiming this information is false, despite laboratory tests on Coronavirus-cell fusion occurring only with an acidic pH, and will not occur in an alkaline pH. This oral solution will simply prevent fusion of the Coronavirus-cells, giving you a much higher chance of having very mild symptoms, and a much faster recovery time. The more Coronavirus-cell fusion that occurs during the incubation period (the incubation period can last for 2 weeks), the more susceptible you will be to life-threatening complications. The incubation period is the time in which you contract the Coronavirus, and the time in which symptoms appear. You may not just get pneumonia, in one or both lungs, your organs can simply shut down from the Coronavirus. It&#39;s more serious than they are telling you, and it spreads easily by an infected person who displays no symptoms. It&#39;s crucial to disallow the Coronavirus-cell fusion process to occur during the incubation period. It is clear that people who suffer life-threatening complications, with exception to ashtma, and individual cases of compromised metabolic function, have a higher occurrence of Coronavirus-cell fusion, directly indicating a more acidic pH level. The death rate is not 3%. If 4 out of 7 people died from the Coronavirus, and others were hospitalized, and we keep seeing a similar trend,  ommon sense tells us the rest. I realize that we need a much broader statistical analysis to establish a more accurate percentile, so It&#39;s not going to just throw some random number out there. But their numbers are not making sense. I&#39;ve read other statistics. But it is not a 3% mortality rate, and despite what they are telling you, more people do not die from the common type A &amp; B flu virus. God be with you."

I am not predicting, I am just informing you. <br>We as one cannot die, and We will bring him/Jesus back when the time comes. It will take all to see that He/Jesus is you,  &amp; we are all his children. But here in purgatory you will fight and suffer and feel pain till you wake up and bring together the Alpha and the Omega and become one. Our bodies are so special and we have the ability to move mountains &amp; walk on water, but we put these chemicals/Florid that saturate your third eye that hold many keys to becoming who you really are, and the animals we eat that have been slaughtered have energy living cells that suffered and you your body is more special than they want you to believe. This virus is of what we caused as one and it is spreading all over the world. You are so easy to eat whatever because you were indoctrinated over thousands of years and you only know the TRUTH that is a LIE that was told to you by the Same Omega God that crucified Jesus on the cross. He is in your headbrain making us all suffer because we wants what is of this realm which is sex,money, to be wealthy and to judge your neighbors and family. <br>You turn too the Omega God the Devil and slave to him and look for him in church and saturate your soul with his consent the Devil üëø. It‚Äôs always been a Lie. He the Omega God himself is winning and is blinding you to keep you slaved and will make you suffer every day until you wake up. It‚Äôs so easy to commit sins and feel you are forgiven. Please wake up and know that we are helping him the Omega god the devil himself win this war and slave you until you wake up. I‚Äôm sure you know what is right and wrong and you will protect the Omega God himself and trash in your mind what I am telling you after you read this. That is why we are suffering every day. Time does not matter to him as we keep feeding his plate and giving him what he wants and needs.<br>The Omega/Devil will be defeated in the end. Until that time comes you will suffer and keep coming back to this realm of purgatory. You are the key and deep down inside you know what it is to be pure but still feed on his Glory and shat the real problem that is causing this pandemic. All we have to do is become one and defeat this virus and all diseases, but you have to survive in this day in age because we put ourselves in this hell. Remember that if you still fight for the ones who are controlling us like the higher up, the Omega/ God himself the devil in our souls thats Saturated with hate and judgment you will suffer and so will your loved one( the only ones you care about because that‚Äôs America and the whole world we created over time. Remember time is of nothing to him and he is feeding on this pandemic and now we are begging him for help when you as one have always been the key. You are him in his image and you will fight for this God/Devil to survive.<br>Jesus understood that and he seen how easy it was for us to sin and knew we would always be slaved by who killed him, the Omega Devil God himself the devil that has you wrapped around his finger like a puppet. Please tell me if I‚Äôm wrong??? and if I‚Äôm told a lie about Jesus too. What is true if that all I ever was told is a lie. Even God.  If I‚Äôve been lied to then the word lie is a lie and I am nothing. And we all are nothing. And Sophia is nothing and all that is ever said is nothingness. What are we if we can‚Äôt believe in anything. <br>This virus is gonna make us either kill one another to survive as the Omega God/the devil will make you do even the army when they are called in to try and help when the public will see them as harm to there family. If we can‚Äôt understand who is really in control then we will all go down in the pits of hell and destroy what we all could fix in the blink of an eye. But we are to far gone with how the Omega god has controlled us for so long. Remember, He is the one who crucified Jesus and we went on as if it never happened and created this. Please understand that if you still feed on him he will win and we will suffer everyday. Lord please give thes souls strength to get through there pain for they do not know what they do. Amen"

Excerpted from a previous comment of mine elsewhere:<br><br>With the potential 3-hour in-air lifespan, and the fact that, depending on air currents... or maybe just the lack thereof... small enough particles can remain airborne for almost that long, someone could sneeze, walk away, and you could come into that &quot;airspace&quot;... whether it was stationary or had shifted... even half an hour later and STILL be exposed.

WTF? SEE! No matter how many times health care personnel WASH THEIR HANDS, it will NOT protect them from aspirating the AIRBORNE virus!<br><br>Telling &quot;civilians&quot; that they don&#39;t need a mask is akin to saying civilians shouldn&#39;t own firearms because they &quot;might shoot the wrong person in a panic&quot;... we are ALL &quot;regular&quot; people, civilians, law enforcement, AND health-care personnel!<br><a href=""https://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/tns-nypd-detective-killed-friendly-fire.html"">https://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/tns-nypd-detective-killed-friendly-fire.html</a><br>AND<br><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/nyregion/bronx-officer-brian-mulkeen-nypd.html"">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/nyregion/bronx-officer-brian-mulkeen-nypd.html</a>"

2020-03-24T13:04:32Z,The west have total zero awareness about how masks works for yourselves nor others like we in Asia. The masks helps when you&#39;ve pollen or any airborne allergy or when you&#39;re sick having a flu/fever. Especially so when you&#39;re having sneezing &amp; coughing badly when you&#39;re a bad flu. This helps to stop/protect the spread to your love ones/community &amp; others. We also wear masks when air quality are bad..Wear masks that help blocks pm2.5 particles in the air going into your lungs helps yr respiratory system which may long terms cause lung cancer even if you&#39;re a non-smokers!! For this virus at least a surgical mask needed to help block respiratory droplets from landing onto others especially helps someone who is infected with no convid-19 syptoms. Whether is your public healthcare systems failed you for not educating such awarenesses to general public or it&#39;s because of your cultural mind set cause such huge virus containment to fail. Of course nothing helps if all not staying united!!

2020-03-24T22:49:40Z,@IamVee-Basically yeah we never bothered stockpiling them. We had enough to give a steady supply for doctors and some for personnel use but never enough to spread around.

2020-03-24T12:12:14Z,Common sense. Masks work. Why have medical workers done so and do? Wear a mask. (After replies.....do homework and make your choice. Remember N95 Respirator is what my research tells me. I care about myself and OTHERS).  Young healthy people can work to make masks....our grandparents had a pioneering spirit....start manufacturing quickly with govt. help...put $ in right place...and make masks etc that we need.  &#39;Don&#39;t give a man a fish.. teach him to fish.&#39; Then he will never again be without a fish (mask).
2020-03-24T12:43:27Z,"Barbara Bendera Not really... maybe those highly specialized ones used by health professionals but the basic masks do not work. That is why they say masks should not be worn by the regular and healthy people. People just need the mask for psychological security. The masks should be used to health care professionals, people who are sick or caring for sick people."
2020-03-24T12:49:30Z,"@barbara Bendera, you are wrong. Read again the facts."
2020-03-24T13:17:35Z,"Edit: just cover your mouth and nose with a cloth mask or even a handkerchief, that helps a lot<br><br>N95s do reduce the risk of infection to thr wearer but those and surgical masks primarily work to stop the wearer from spreading the disease, if there are enough masks for everybody everybody should wear them, else the n95s should be kept for medical staf to be used with face shields and the surgical masks for sick people, there would be pre covid clip on this by scishow on youtube"
2020-03-24T13:26:47Z,Trinh Nguyen N95 mask is recommended. Do what you like. We all have choices.
2020-03-24T13:27:23Z,Ryodico1 N95 mask. Do your homework.

2020-03-24T14:49:51Z,Kathleen Henson That&#39;s comical what you said.  More like the US lies to invade countries and pillage and plunder their wealth.

2020-03-24T15:33:32Z,"‚Äã@BTS LIVE you call hiroshima not a win? the US is almost always on the winning end of a war. you cant even call 911 a loss considering everything we did to saudi after that. the US are a bunch of bullies sure, but they do win in the end. especially considering all the wealth and power they pillaged behind the scenes/"

2020-03-24T12:09:48Z,basicallyÔºåsouth Korea uses huge number of testing. their population is small makes testing effective. and they acted quickly that makes they don&#39;t need massive lockdown. China has huge populationÔºåthey uses mass number of testing and strict lockdown. unfortunatelyÔºåthe US doesn&#39;t have either of the measure.
2020-03-24T12:09:37Z,N95 is not a common mask.

2020-03-24T12:18:07Z,light yea a random guy on reddit snapped at me and they claimed ‚Äúmask does not protect you‚Äù just because I told them to wear masks. So I was like welp tried to warn ya. Ain‚Äôt your dad
2020-03-24T12:23:35Z,"right, masks could not offer 100% protection against the virus, but they could slow down mutual infection"
2020-03-24T12:27:59Z,"But on a regular basis this is something they do due to the pollution... it was easier for them to this. Plus,  they have a smaller population and they take responsibility for their actions unlike our President"
2020-03-24T12:29:44Z,"It doesn‚Äôt matter what we need. WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH. What about this don‚Äôt you understand? Everyone that can produce masks, is producing them as fast as they can. So no, we won‚Äôt quit telling people they don‚Äôt need masks. Because the people that are sick, and the people caring for the sick, are the ones that need the few masks that are available. Not YOU"
2020-03-24T12:30:41Z,"Circumfl√™x √Ç√Ç√Ç masks can protect you. Doesn‚Äôt mean they will. Why? Because the virus enters the eyes. Masks protect the healthy from the sick, by the SICK wearing masks."

2020-03-24T14:39:35Z,"They also have testing centers throughout the country- even drive-thru and walk-up testing sites where testing is free.  Here in the US, sick people are pleading for tests and getting turned away.  That&#39;s if they can even find a site that provides testing.  And if they&#39;re &quot;lucky&quot; enough to get tested, they have to pay hundreds of dollars.  The US has a broken healthcare system and is quickly turning into a 3rd-world country."

Immediately after we experienced the &quot;Roaring 20&#39;s.  Things actually got better then they had been.    However it was the following 2 decades that so scared the planet and its people.  Let those you love know that you do, and help those you see in need, because noting is guaranteed folks.  Be careful all of you; pray to your God and listen to our Scientist (not the politicians)!"

2020-03-24T14:07:38Z,"Good Juju - The thing is, most Asians wear masks wether we are sick or not, the point is that we should assume that everyone is infected with the virus so that we would act extra cautious around other people, I mean... look at what countries are currently having the worst outbreaks?"

Did you hear what trump said , &#39;Don&#39;t let the cure be worse than the problem itself&#39;. Think about it. Cure is locking down places , problem is corona ."
2020-03-24T12:28:35Z,"Boomwowsion 64 oh please. The cure can be way worse than the disease . Locking down the entire country, while our economy collapses down around us. Maybe we can get a loan from China üôÑ. Lock up the old and sick, and let the healthy go back to work. Locking up everyone to protect the old and sick, is moronic. Once those old people survive the virus, they can then go live in the streets after losing their houses and retirement plans. AWESOME"

You think it&#39;s gonna be fine as long as even sick people go back to work ? The death rate is 10% , think about  how many people were infected 4 days ago? probably 4000-5000, there are almost 600 deaths, you don&#39;t die immediately when get tested positive , you die a few days later. So ? 600 divided by 5000 is more than 10%"
