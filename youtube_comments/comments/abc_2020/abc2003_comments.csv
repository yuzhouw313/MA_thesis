2020-04-04T06:39:49Z,Doctors wear mask for a reason so why shouldn&#39;t we wear them too. This is the reason why the USA have the most covid 19 cause not much people was wearing mask. Which spread quickly. Tsk tsk.  Why are we always so slow in response to this type of situation.
2020-04-04T06:38:05Z,What Americans and the rest of the world don&#39;t understand is the fact that the Korean president and its government can be kicked out by people if they don&#39;t act properly in a national emergency.

US administration downplayed it &amp; did not prepare, now US citizens can’t get masks anywhere, ventilators are in short supply, and US looks extremely ill-prepared and weak in the eyes of the world. US is supposed to be a leader of the free world, but South Korea is making it look like a 3rd world country in no help by US administration who never took it seriously from the start. Now US is scrambling as cases continue to rise and there is not enough supplies, masks, technology set in place to fight it. All they can tell us is to social distance and wash hands, state governors are stepping up but the US federal government has the most power to help fight the spread, they could have had many US companies shift their manufacturing to masks, hand sanitizer, alcohol, ventilator, &amp; medical supply as well as put together more advanced tech to track it all. But they didn’t because Trump is a moron who believe what he feels more than what scientists are tell him. Literally any president with any common sense could have prepared properly if they just listen to leading scientistic experts and worked with other countries instead of just focusing on re-election and stock market numbers."

USA cannot use Cellphone and Credit Card to track people without a Court Warrant, it is in violation of the privacy act.  Korea is mass-tracking population without warrants (no law grant the USA government this power).<br><br>2. Korea is a manufacturing powerhouse, so it can produce PPE, Mask and Ventilators.   USA already outsourced 95% of such &quot;low-tech-low-profit&quot; product else where.  USA simple don&#39;t have trained worker and tooling companies to ramp up production like the Koreans did.  <br><br>3.  Mentality:  Korean experience the SARS and MERS outbreak in the past 20 years, most living people in USA never experienced something like this until the COVID19, people simply isn&#39;t serious."

There is a many reason. <br>First, the panic buying is a situation when people can&#39;t trust each other and government. We trust our goverment Moon president and the government give us an credible information.<br>Second, Korean people are very kind and familyer each other so we care our neghibor, too. For example, if there&#39;s only two toilet papers left(if that is impossble situation in KOREA), although we get them all, we share one to other NOT fighting each other. It is a result of us becoming the most civilized in KOREA. It is too different when we see the situation of our around countries(North KOREA, CHINA!!!!!!!, JAPEN who is press down a mass)<br>Third, we are having a very very good structure of medical system in the world. This is because only the government give people an medical insurance. we only pay at most 5% of a total cost of our medic care.<br>Firth, our doctors and nurses volunteerly care people cost of their exhaust of energy and civil charity help medical people by borrowing a hotel for free and giving them a food and courage. <br>So we confirm we shell get through this virus for few months. Please get the mask on. Mask is not for yourself. It&#39;s prevent virus moving form one to others. Please get the mask ON!! always."

Whereas in Westerns, people who are sick or medics are encouraged to wear face masks."

2020-03-30T06:53:06Z,Koreans respect other people much more than Americans.
2020-03-30T06:33:48Z,"I am a Korean, I am proud of myself as a Korean. Now, Korea is very peaceful and can not find any social chaos at all. <br>The infection rate of COVID19   is definitely falling down. Now the recovery rate from corona infection is more increasing than new infection.<br>Total infected people in Korea are 9000 people and recovered people are 5000 people. <br>I want tell you how the infection rate is falling down in Korea is as follows;  <br>1. The most advanced democratic system. <br>  =&gt; Never Korean government have controlled people&#39;s freedom ,  never closed social door. and never closed airport. <br>       Moreover Korean government has been accepting criticisms from many social, public press and people. <br>      the government has never controlled or ignored  their criticisms. According to their criticism, <br>      our government is collecting and correcting  their policy again and again. <br>    <br>       But Korean government is reacting seriously against even one person&#39;s infection and the center for disease<br>      control of Korea is sending  SMS  alert message to each person through Mobile phone  like that infected person <br>       of No.1 or...No.30 COVID was a certain of building, a certain of restaurant or what metro etc. and the authorities<br>      gives final report  that &quot;disinfecting operation is completed and the infected person is now under isolation in a hospital&quot; <br>      and people near by  him or her are under isolation in their house.  If the  people violate the rule related to the self   isolation,  <br>    they get a serious penalty from our government. <br><br><br>2. The most advanced medical system. <br>     =&gt; We pay 3~8% medical insurance depending on incomes from all labor or business as the duty,  <br>        All people who do social activity must pay  medical insurance. So, all Korean people even thought they are rich<br>        or poor gets medical treatment with very very low price. <br>        If we get a cold, we can get the medical treatment in the hospital at less than 5 dollars. and drugs are just one or<br>        two dollars in the pharmacy.<br>        In case of COVID, if someone else get a cold and take diagnosis for that, the person pays USD100 in case of <br>       no COVID infection, however if the person gets infection diagnosis, the USD100 is returned from the public medical<br>       insurance authorities. <br>         However, if the infected  person gets medical treatment in the hospital, the  medical fee is really low  or mostly free <br>       by the public medical insurance. <br><br><br>3. The most advanced citizenship and mobile networking. <br>   I know that panic buying (Hoarding ) is serious in some countries, and saw a  fight by hitting each other <br>   because of a pack of tissue in the supermarket through  youtub and was mostly empty there. <br>   But, absolutely there is no panic buying in Korea, there are a lot of tissues, foods and many life articles in every market <br><br><br>  In stead of increasing price, many supermarkets take discount promotion in stead of increasing price. <br>   Surely there was hoarding case with Mask shortly in Korea, now no more hoarding for the mask under the control of Korean government.<br>   We can buy two pcs at USD 1 every week in the pharmacy in Korea, but nobody tries to buy mask faster and they keeps a line <br>  to wait buying the mask in front of pharmacy. Surely we can buy from 3~4 dollars through internet shopping mall. <br>   if we are not lazy, we can buy  masks without any problem with USD1. <br><br>  Moreover, there  is mobile application to help the people who wants to buy the mask easily and  want to find out a pharmacy <br>  to have stocks.<br>  there are also many mobile application to help buying mask and inform the infected people&#39;s stay in Korea. Never we have a panic<br>   on internet service as well. <br>    Moreover, every elevator in every building , public  toilet and every restaurant furnishes a hand disinfectant . <br>   If you are in Korea, you can  see hand disinfectant every toilet and elevator. in case of myself, i am living a apartment, <br>   and there is a hand disinfectant in the elevator all the time<br>   But nobody steals the hand disinfectant there at all. the disinfectant can be used by everyone as needs <br>   Moreover, we can buy them in the supermarket with cheap price as well.  Never steal anything and never hoarding are happened in Korea. <br>    Korean people are really responsible to every of their duties, for that reason, there are many things to occupy industrial top rank <br>   in the world such as electronics, ships  mechanics and constructions etc in the world. <br>   <br>   One of most proud things which makes me shame also is many volunteers. The city &quot;Dae-Gu&quot; was occupied with 80% infection rate<br>   because of Shinchun-Ji which is a false religion. <br>   Because of this false religion makes saponaceus spread with COVID to all area in SK. About 500 doctors  closed their hospital <br>   and stopped their living activities and went to the city &quot;Daegu&quot; to participate as volunteers and worked for nothing ,<br>   with  the only  intention to help people.<br>   Also thousands nurses also participated as volunteers and cared many infected people even though they work <br>   more than 15 hours in a days without any complaining.  <br>   Moreover, students also are participating as volunteer to provide foods for the infected people by secret without  any invasion of human\<br>   right for the infected people.  <br>  So, Korean people tries to help each other every we have crisis. Moreover,  in another cases was that more than ONE MILLION PEOPLE <br>   worked  and helped as volunteer when a ship have crashed a oil carrier and the beach of the accident area was very serious pollution <br>   from oil spread on the sea. Thanks to million volunteers could recovered sea pollution within 50 days. <br>   Many professionalists said the pollution can be recovered even to 10 years at that time. <br>  <br>   You know that we had a bitter experience from Japan&#39;s colonialism for 45 years, Korean war for 3 years, democratic campaign against <br>military dictators, economic crisis controlled by IMF,  and kicking off our previous president by non violence by keeping public order. <br>Specially when we were suffered from economic crisis &quot;1997~2000&quot; we could escape  very shortly from IMF control <br>by voluntary participation campaign to collect golds. <br>Many Korean people have survived their country to donate their precious gold memorizing their marriage, heritage of their parents etc. <br><br>The most powerful weapon of Korea is not military one, but it is just citizenship of Koreans experienced by many chaotic times.  <br>Korean people are accepting governmental recommendation, surely there is no violation or punishment from Korean government. <br> But Most Korean people are well acting on government guide without any chaos and any criticism, <br>We really respect our Korean government and thanks to them. we love our government to keep the real democratic way.<br><br><br>The three things as mentioned above are the power to control COVID 19 earlier .<br>I want to say that the country can have a long and continuous development with a good citizenship even though a government is stupid. <br>The most important thing to recover this case  is to aware what is citizenship under the democraticism.  <br><br><br>Don&#39;t forget Korean people have kicked off our previous president who had a serious corruptions peacefully without any violation <br>by keeping public order, ie)  cleaning out all street after protest against our previous president. The protest was like a festival. <br><br><br>The three things i mentioned above are the way to recover COVID 19 and they are The Power of Korea."

2020-03-30T05:17:40Z,"I think the anti-Chinese propaganda is what we should expect from Rothschild-controlled media.<br><br>The Coronavirus was engineered at universities in the US (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Yale; and Harvard) and Canada (University of Manitoba). <br><br>&quot;[I]nitial research on the COVID-19 outbreak led nearly immediately to the work of Dr. Ralph Baric. A microbiologist and chemistry professor at the University of North Carolina who had raised the eyebrows and the ire of the immunological community in 2015 by undertaking an unauthorized “gain of function” study for the synthesis of a supercharged SARS coronavirus. Work strictly forbidden by both the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. Both Baric’s hubris in ignoring a CDC/WHO contravention against gain of function studies and his clear disregard for the consequences of his activities immediately captured instinctual attention as someone whose activities bore closer inspection for potential connection to the Wuhan crisis that is now a global pathogen gaining momentum with each passing day.<br><br>All that was missing was a direct connection between Baric’s maverick killer coronavirus research and the BSL-4 lab in Wuhan at the (Wuhan Institute for Science and Technology) that serves as China’s only bioweapons research facility, located in the very city where the COVID-19 pandemic began.&quot;<br><br><a href=""http://www.shadolsonshow.com/2020/01/13/covid-19-born-in-north-carolina-sold-to-wuhan-lab-optimize"">http://www.shadolsonshow.com/2020/01/13/covid-19-born-in-north-carolina-sold-to-wuhan-lab-optimize</a><br><br>While the researchers working in Canada were all Chinese - probably because they were the ones with the most expertise, and often people managing research projects believe that having a common first language is an asset - a few of the researchers were kicked off the research team based on reported suspicions of revealing secrets to people in China. I believe that they were trying to warn people in China what these viruses were designed to do.<br><br>According to Brian Owens (&quot;Mystery surrounds ouster of Chinese researchers from Canadian laboratory&quot;):<br><br>&quot;Canadian researchers are reacting with puzzlement to the news that a “policy breach” has caused the nation’s only high-containment disease laboratory to bar a prominent Chinese Canadian virologist, her biologist husband, and a number of students from the facility.<br><br>On 5 July, officials at the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, Canada, escorted Xiangguo Qiu, biologist Keding Cheng, and an unknown number of her students from the lab and revoked their access rights, according to Canadian media reports. The Public Health Agency of Canada, which operates the lab, confirmed it had referred an “administrative matter” matter to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, but said it would not provide additional details because of privacy concerns.<br><br>A number of observers have speculated that case involves concerns about the improper transfer of intellectual property to China. (All of the researchers involved are believed to be Asian.) But Frank Plummer, a former scientific director of NML who left in 2015, says the lab isn’t an obvious target for academic or industrial espionage. “There is nothing highly secret there, and all the work gets published in the open literature,” he says. “I don’t know what anyone would hope to gain by spying.”<br><br>The lab works in a wide range of biomedical fields. Qiu is known for helping develop ZMapp, a treatment for Ebola virus that was fast-tracked through development during the 2014–16 outbreak in West Africa. She has repeatedly been honored for her work on that project, including with a Governor General’s Innovation Award last year.<br><br>“While I was there [Qiu] was always highly regarded as a scientist,” says Plummer, adding that he was “shocked and puzzled” when he heard she was being investigated. “She maintained connections with China, but as far as I knew she was a regular Canadian scientist.”<br><br>Cheng, Qiu’s husband, also worked as a biologist at NML. And both researchers held adjunct faculty positions at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg. It says it has terminated their positions and reassigned their students as a result of the investigation.&quot;<br><br><a href=""https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/07/mystery-surrounds-ouster-chinese-researchers-canadian-laboratory#"">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/07/mystery-surrounds-ouster-chinese-researchers-canadian-laboratory#</a><br><br>-------------------------------<br><br>Since the outbreak the Chinese have reportedly sequenced the virus; so of course they would have the leading technological edge necessary to create the testing kits. It would only be wise for the rest of the world to not ignore the genetic research already performed in China.<br><br>Why are these &quot;yellow&quot; &quot;news outlets&quot; in India giving such an anti-Chinese slant on the story? The most obvious reason would be that China is trying to gain India as an ally in order to fight the &quot;Chinese virus&quot; label that has been foisted on the sheeple - and I believe that the Rothschilds are behind the smears. It could even be that being Chinese was a predetermined qualification for being hired for the research conducted in Canada so they could later propagate the &quot;Chinese are to blame&quot; narrative they wished to tell from the start.<br><br><a href=""https://www.deccanherald.com/international/world-news-politics/china-seeks-india-s-support-to-counter-us-bid-to-lay-covid-19-blame-on-its-door-817288.html"">https://www.deccanherald.com/international/world-news-politics/china-seeks-india-s-support-to-counter-us-bid-to-lay-covid-19-blame-on-its-door-817288.html</a><br><br>Why would the Rothschilds and their globalist friends wish to smear the Chinese? Probably for multiple reasons. <br><br>1) The globalist plan to wipe out much of the population of China has apparently been largely thwarted.<br><br>2) The Western pharmaceutical companies had planned to capitalise on demand for the vaccines that would be sold for hundreds of billions due to the &quot;pandemic&quot;; but the Chinese companies they don&#39;t control have apparently outsmarted them by sequencing the virus before they did and sharing this information with the Koreans, who have apparently formed a strategic economic alliance with China so that they can turn the tables on those which wished to make these economies collapse. In fact, there are no lockdown measures necessary with the approach the Koreans have taken.<br><br>3) The fact that there are examples of countries such as Korea, where no draconian measures are necessary would call into question why (plans for) such draconian &quot;soft martial law&quot; measures are being implemented in much of the rest of the world along with the mobilisation of global military police forces which apparently are being prepared to fight the mass rioting as well as enforce the coming ID2020 system proposed by Bill Gates: of course they would anticipate that many would resist getting a biosensor chip implanted into their bodies.<br><br>4) The Bank of China has been buying up a lot of gold lately. I believe the Rothschilds may have been trying to collapse the Chinese economy so that the Chinese would be forced to sell much of that gold back to the Rothschild banks before the banking systems &quot;reboot&quot; after world economic collapse."

2020-03-29T16:39:51Z,Should also take a look on how Taiwan’s doing... they r incredible
2020-03-29T16:32:47Z,"To answer questions. <br><br>It is plain as the nose on your face, why this expert didn&#39;t say it, I don&#39;t know.<br>(1) There are areas in the USA that look like they don&#39;t have a big problem,<br>THAT is because they have way less population (density) and they are probably<br>practicing social distancing and they aren&#39;t fully tested. They probably have<br>more infections but know it. Just like in the North East, we thought the<br>infection wasn&#39;t high, UNTIL we get testing moving. If you say go back to work,<br>you could raise the rates of infection and negate the effects of social<br>distancing this harming the people and hampering the containment of the virus.<br>(2) If you look around the world, it takes 3 to 4 weeks for a sick person to<br>recover, we haven&#39;t been infected long enough (and tested) to see and track<br>recovered cases. (3) The ONLY people who need to be at work are the healthcare<br>workers and support services, police, supply chain for food and medical etc.<br>THEY need every PPE they can get so they are protected, PERIOD, the states<br>should not have to ask, the FEDS should deliver ASAP no questions asked, the<br>healthcare system is working OVERTIME to save our lives. (4) If we don&#39;t have<br>the patience (fortitude) to stick to the EASIEST way of defeating the virus<br>(social distancing) then we are idiots. Once the number of infections level off<br>and start to decline ONLY THEN can we project a time to return carefully to<br>work. Looking around the world to see how long that has taken, Chins, S Korea,<br>Iran, Italy, etc. That data will give us the timeline. (4) It is OBVIOUS that<br>social distancing IS the STRONGEST weapon we have to combat this and any other<br>virus. On its own the virus will probably die off in 2 to 3 weeks if it can&#39;t<br>spread to another host (person). (5) Listen to the professional EXPERTS, not<br>politicians or news anchors. This information (REAL) information is what the<br>talking heads should be spreading. (6) Our politicians - leaders should be<br>backing the experts, telling the people what the government can and will do to<br>get the people of the USA through this situation we weren&#39;t prepared for. The<br>CARE ACT IS a very strong attempt to do just that! Be patience, be smart, be<br>calm, don&#39;t be greedy at the food and pharmacy stores. Support each other, we<br>are or should be a team in the crisis. We don&#39;t need BS from anyone, we need a<br>solid real, smart plan to achieve a goal. Citizen of the USA"
2020-03-29T16:21:34Z,I just don&#39;t know why it&#39;s so hard for American people to wear masks.South Korea and many countries already approved wearing masks are helpful.

Korean people are suffering and we don&#39;t trust government .only president moon side people are satisfied. we  start protect ourself and help each other  and it gets better.  it is not from government. We have to standing a line whole day for  buying  the mask .therefore young boy died after he lined up in week ago.  The boy had  got a positive results onetime but government want to say it&#39;s not from coronavirus. SO he had to testing 7times for get NOT POSITIVE after he died.  The sad  thing is the boy doesn&#39;t have chance to get treatment until he died.  they don&#39;t support  own people. <br> If you can read korean then please check real korean video.

Soooo funny..That&#39;s just korean personality matter. N.korea always  trying send us missile so we are already educated for that how to control our mind. Like Japanese people learnd how to act when they happen   earthquake.  2nd, do you know that we stop checking korean people for coronavirus testing anymore even you have symptoms. If you have a symptom, you have to take x-ray and show them( which means you have to spend money for atleast $300+ us dollars (in korean money ₩170(test fee+x-ray fee= approximately ₩300 plus) but it&#39;s free for foreigner and they just check from the gate. I guess, They stopped testing people because of election is coming( April 16.2020).  3rd,  many people died  similar symptoms like corona  but government says it&#39;s not from coronavirus and they they don&#39;t count.  my question is why so many people are dying at hospital in this time?"

We should all take an example and learn from Asian culture... Covid 19 is not about competitive races or power struggles... this is one and only about humanity that needs to be helped quickly, efficiently and effectively!

2020-03-29T13:59:23Z,Being Korean American myself and have been in both countries in past few months I can say Koreans in general are more considerate of others therefore there’s no issue of panic buying. Also social distancing is more natural for them since people usually only socialize within those close to them. There has always been strict line of “strictly business” &amp; “friends”. Also they do have great medical welfare system which US is far behind. Their moto is to take care of citizens as opposed to make money off of them.
2020-03-29T13:54:52Z,"Governments, media and docs in US are probably aware about the importance of face masks. They&#39;re not mentioning it as much because people are going to go crazy for buying masks and the supply and demand chain for masks are no where close to cover the whole population of US"

2020-03-29T09:31:11Z,"(안녕하세요)Hi. I am a person living in Korea. It was very shocking to hear about the recent increase in corona infections in the United States. I hope people from all over the world, including the United States, will join forces to end this disaster.(sorry for not speaking English well)"
2020-03-29T09:10:36Z,That cell phone/credit card data search is interesting. US should have done that instead of just mentioning that someone in the city has corona. Would have been helpful to know if people was in the same area as the infected person
2020-03-29T09:00:08Z,Guys. Get mask. It is not so difficult.
2020-03-29T08:39:05Z,"My country should REALLY LEARNS from you, neighbour. Even when we have 2 weeks to a month with 0 covid19, while knowing we are surrounded by countries which have announced virus infection, most of my fellow citizens actually LAUGH at it!!! And i and fellow citizens like me who actually used one are LAUGHED AT!. Dumbasses!!!😡"
2020-03-29T08:25:15Z,They only lockdown one city. And  they even develop an app for tracking corona positive patients.
2020-03-29T08:00:37Z,"Best part is while you people stay inside, spreading it to each other, ive got friends intentionally coughing on packages and sending them to houses / buusnesses😁. The spread has reached critical mass, soon you all will die and without a vaccine millions more will perish 😃"
2020-03-29T07:53:30Z,"Somewhere else they only require to wear mask if you are sick. What if you were feeling fine in the morning, went out to work or do your errands and then in the afternoon you started feeling sick &amp; started sneezing &amp; coughing &amp; not wearing mask. Droplets flying everywhere. By the time you already infected few people you come in contact with. Sick or not we should wear mask when going outside."
2020-03-29T07:46:41Z,"yeah but korea isn&#39;t filled with entitled youngsters, homeless, meth heads, overly religious people, and gang bangers."
2020-03-29T07:42:39Z,"The US leadership took it as a joke. The US leadership IS THE  joke. U.S. leadership pussyfoots &amp; is as useless  as a limp -----. Korean leadership knows what they are doing, are organized, and will track you!!!"
2020-03-29T07:35:00Z,"You have to understand that wearing a mask here in asia are not to avoid people who coughing/ sneezing. It’s more likely to prevent our hand to touch our nose/ mouth accidentally, cause everything u touch on the public area can be 99% exposed with the virus."
2020-03-29T07:29:12Z,"if there zombie apocalypse maybe east asian country like japan, china and korea is safe choice to survive...."
2020-03-29T07:25:42Z,People in the world wide please wear mask even you are not sick. Wearing mask not only stops viruses spread from carrier but also it filter viruses from outside so that protect your lungs from it. That&#39;s the reason why doctors in hospital are wearing mask. Also viruses stick to your hand so wash your hand with soap to kill them if you got outside. I hope you guys are safe by doing it. :D

2020-03-29T05:15:59Z,Asymptomatic carrier in Korea is said to be 20%. That is main reason we want all the people to wear them.
2020-03-29T04:58:15Z,"The US is well prepared for war with its military might. The US is ill prepared for a health pandemic. They were slow to react, don&#39;t have the tools, and care more about business growth than the health of its people."

2020-03-29T04:28:35Z,Proud Korean right here TT
2020-03-29T04:26:08Z,I think everyone should wear masks even if they think they are not sick. Cuz what if you have COVID 19 but won’t tell right away. You risk spreading it to someone. Then you start feeling the symptoms and by that time- I bet someone else has it. <br>America truly is stupid. And the only reason we are out of masks it’s cuz some stupid people are out here panic buying more than what they need.
2020-03-29T04:02:25Z,Ever think Korea is just not reporting actual numbers
2020-03-29T03:49:02Z,America is not a little behind. They’re way behind other countries that they criticize and it’s a shame. They can’t even get the people to stay home to stop the spread!
2020-03-29T03:18:15Z,"You need to use a mask to stop the corona virus.<br>The reason you need to wear a mask to prevent coronavirus is that it is worn so that it does not come into contact with the respiratory organs.<br>Wear it for yourself, your family and your country."

(all imported cases, no local transmission cases so far).We have the highest CoVID-19 testing rate in South Asia which is done free of cost. We are just a small country, considered poor by other countries but we have everything in place to tackle CoVID-19.  🇧🇹🙏"
2020-03-29T02:03:56Z,"Slow the rate of transmission, should be the slogan, not flattening the curve. The latter is non-descriptive and obtuse, the former is clear.,"
2020-03-29T01:55:55Z,"With all respect I would like to add my 2 cents/won. I think S. Korea is a great country and treats its citizens with caring. And the Korean people are caring of their country. I once that the opportunity of spending 3 weeks in South Korea. My over whelming impression was it was green and very clean. And rightfully so, the people take great pride in their country. This cannot be said about the majority of people in the United States. Some think the world is their garbage dump and will through their trash on the ground while standing by a container. Yes, we are arrogant, loud and very selfish. Not everyone but enough to give us a president that is ignorant, vulgar, etc. However, in our defense I would like to remind people we are a very big country, especially compared with most countries. Our population is about 327.2 million whereas SK is 51.47 million. Our land area is 9,629,091 SqKm and SK is about 100,000 SqKm. We have 50 state government with their own rules and regulations that may be different than those of the federal government. Probably the biggest difference compared to Asia is the US is a very young country and we do not have the wisdom of age like the Asian countries. Compared to most of the world we are young, restless and still trying to find our way to maturity. So please be patient with us because we are still learning."
2020-03-29T01:53:14Z,No panic buying here.. all people are chill bt still some are hard headed.. the government said no religious gathering bt some churches do it and spread the virus hay :(.. and it has system here every week we can buy 2 mask..

As a result, you can be walking around in midnight alone without worrying about getting mugged or getting pickpocketed. What’s better? Government knowing what you wore yesterday or you constantly being cautious and effectively disabling yourself from going to certain places at certain times? What gives more freedom?

2020-03-28T23:54:50Z,The South Korean government has built a system to prepare for the epidemics even before the outbreaks in China. They also made orders to bio companies to produce the diagnosis kits right after they found the first infected case in Korea.

2020-03-28T14:36:03Z,"I hope we can come up with a solution that can be deployed anywhere. south korean model is not for everyone. it still requires high degree of infrastructure and medical quality. but non-OECD countries don&#39;t have this. This is an world wide issue... I really want something can help everyone, not only those developed countries"
2020-03-28T15:18:31Z,Its true. But test is most effective. No test No gain
2020-03-28T14:29:58Z,Its so simple to america to stop spreading the virus wear your mask and stay at home...here in the philippines we have 800+ possitive in covid19 can you imagine one of the poorest country in the world but look not thousand are affected because we are wearing mask and self quarantine because we are afraid to die and we love our family we love our country.....and to all the fronliners SALUTE👏👏👏👏👏👊👊👊👊💞

2020-03-28T16:53:36Z,Lmao
2020-03-28T14:02:13Z,This is pointless we can &#39; t follow a model that we don&#39;t even have half the tools to comply with. Watching these is just truly learning how stupid and worthless your governments response has been.
2020-03-28T13:58:52Z,Philippines please take note.

2020-03-28T13:03:50Z,"I live in South Korea and here most of the people wear masks in the public and the government is providing us masks. I&#39;ve heard the experts saying &quot;Masks can&#39;t protect you from virus.&quot; But i believe that masks can protect us from virus and slow down the spreading speed. You don&#39;t know the exact time the people who are infected will come. Virus can be spread by air. Although the virus can stay in your hand,  you can wash your hands clean and use hand sanitizer. I am very concerned that most of the people abroad aren&#39;t wearing masks. I suggest you to wear masks when you go out. Stay in your home, be safe💓"
2020-03-28T12:57:22Z,"I am a Korean. I feel sorry for the current situation in the American people. I hope the U.S. and Europe are not too late to follow Korea&#39;s quarantine policies. The most worrisome fact is that in Korea, socially important people, certified, celebrities, and professional sports players were not exposed to the coronavirus, but in the United States and Europe, socially famous people were exposed to the coronavirus. This means that the U.S. and European governments still haven&#39;t figured out the path of the coronavirus. In Korea, on the other hand, the possibility of socially important people going to places with high risk of exposure to the coronavirus or contacting people infected with the coronavirus is close to zero. This is because the government actively grasped the information of people exposed to the coronavirus. (The reason for 9,000 Korona patients in Korea despite the efforts of the Korean government is that the foolish cult members with the coronavirus lied to the government.) When we talk about Korea&#39;s quarantine system, many people are concerned about whether we can release the personal information of patients with coronavirus to society. There&#39;s actually no answer. What is clear, however, is that many people in Korea support the Korean government&#39;s decision. All we can do is for individuals to give up some freedom for the sake of the vast majority of safety, while at the same time society gives thanks and encouragement to individuals infected with the coronavirus. Whether this policy is an infringement or a concession depends solely on the thinking of those who look at the matter. someone might think that Koreans follow national policies well because they still don&#39;t know the importance of freedom and individual human rights. But if you knew that Korea was the only country in Asia that established a democratic government through &#39;reform from below&#39;, you wouldn&#39;t say that. (lastly, I hope you can read it considering that it is a comment from someone who is not familiar with English.)"
2020-03-28T12:49:57Z,tracking phone is controlling people blah blah blah
2020-03-29T00:44:52Z,but you do realize the people that downplay the virus are the ones that go outside everywhere and spread it. Aggressive measures need to be taken if they need to contain the virus. I would rather have my privacy taken away then have the virus be constantly  killing people and the economy
2020-03-28T12:17:20Z,"If I don&#39;t wear a mask, then I am a someone who does not care for others"

2020-03-28T12:07:50Z,It&#39;s identical procedure as china did. while china was blamed for civil surveillance ???? double standard.
2020-03-28T12:10:15Z,"As far as I know, China&#39;s data is fake. Unreliable"
2020-03-28T12:18:15Z,@@whereismywalltrust me.  China won&#39;t dare to take that risk on faking data on such an open issue. Look at how drastically different on death rate between US and Italy. Does US fake their data as well?
2020-03-29T02:23:47Z,"@@pastortt4167 omg in what way you would say a figure convincing? the data provided is under the surveillance of WHO and foreign visiting international doctors. I could see no guarantee of the data provided by the US, not fully testing its sick ones and over-testing their wealthy ones."
2020-03-28T11:56:11Z,how to combat this disease from infecting many people? <br><br>1. Self discipline<br>&quot;<br>&quot;<br>&quot;<br>&quot;<br>&quot;<br>&quot;

2020-03-28T11:46:56Z,In S. Korea wearing a mask became a part of etiquette for others around the person.  Please do the same in USA and other countries. I hope it may work.
2020-04-24T05:56:51Z,In Japan and south korea is just the right thing to do if your sick in China it has to do with pollution
2020-03-28T11:46:52Z,"Originally useless test made Coronavirus spread, then Korea imitated the way of Japan.<br>Just check the number of death."

2020-04-15T22:30:56Z,Hahah....I know your just joking 🙃 just to let you know if you bring that warning message to the test center and tell them you were likely exposed.. they will let you take the test for free and treat you free....
2020-03-28T11:33:37Z,They did not have young people on spring break in Florida totally ignorant of how serious this virus is. It&#39;s deadly. They were very childish and stupid. I would think some of them will end up with the virus or a family member may.<br>Someone could possibly die because of those morons. So ignorant and selfish.
2020-03-28T11:10:37Z,"I feel that as an American, we’re a total joke. South Korea has handled it so much better, and they’re working hand in hand with the government. While we’re here with our government in total chaos. In Hawaii, literally everyone is asian and our culture is heavily influenced by a mix of asian cultures. so it’s okay to wear a mask or wear gloves when going out the supermarket at this time cuz some other people are doing that too. I feel so bad that all this racism and xenophobia is happening all over the world, on the mainland I’d feel scared af to go out to the supermarket cuz I’ve seen so many videos of people attacking and harassing Asians over there."

We have been making a lot of masks from the past years because of the smogs coming from China. Those are very bad to health and are made of small particles and we always needed masks in springtime, fall, or winter. Now our mask manufacturing ability is supporting this mask support for citizens during Corona ourbreak...so yeah...this is funny how we got prepared because of China from the virus coming from China.🤨"

Recognizing the seriousness of the virus was the first step that South Korea figured out two months ago, acted swiftly, and transparently by disclosing all information to the public to fend for themselves.  People of South Korea should also be recognized for coming in as a community to help each other especially helping the patients through volunteer activities.  It’s not over for them yet but I hope we can follow their examples to help protect ourselves."

2020-03-27T18:02:27Z,"Korea was initially hit hard after a super spreading event by “patient 31”, but it is Korea’s ability to slow and contain the spread and keep it manageable within its medical capacity that is being praised. Shutting down borders and cities cripples a nation’s economy like you wouldn’t believe, but developing countries like Vietnam (which completely closed its borders as of Mar 22nd) probably have little alternatives and it’s a last ditch effort to stop the spread because once it spreads they know they can’t stop it. South Korea has kept borders open and its citizens are free to move about and live a normal life while also slowing the spread. Oh, and everyone wears masks."

2020-03-27T09:20:29Z,The only reason it reach such high numbers is because of that cult who doesnt believe in sickness and science. They were completely careless. If it werent for the cult South Korea would have done even better and cases would be lower.

2020-03-27T08:25:19Z,South Koreans are well desciplined people
2020-03-27T08:18:48Z,Actually the report touched the part of Contact Tracing. South Korea was allowed by their law to do very intrusive surveillance of its citizens at times of epidemics. They are allowed to access substantial amount of personal data which they can then disclose to the public.<br>Not really sure that can fly in many Western countries especially in US where rights to privacy is more valued.
2020-03-27T08:12:57Z,.. I think I&#39;ll be moving to South Korea real soon...tho I live in Hawaii - this rock does NOT have everything under control...and that&#39;s due to weak people in our Government!!!
2020-03-27T08:06:25Z,Why wouldn’t you wear a mask at this point? Sounds pretty dumb
2020-03-28T02:09:41Z,It is. You can thank the CDC for lying.
2020-03-27T08:05:49Z,And whose fault is this? Government. Yes everyone can think for themselves and what not but if the government doesn’t step in like they did in South Korea then nothing gets done and no one takes it seriously. Exactly what happened here in the US. Shame.
2020-03-27T07:47:23Z,They are spraying something like disinfectant or sanitizer on their town just like China. This might keep virus from getting on to pets or other creatures like rats and birds.

2020-03-28T02:13:17Z,@MkNitara Cloth masks or handkerchiefs. There are instructions online how to make the former. Use multiple handkerchiefs at the same if you choose the latter. You want distance between the cloth touching your mouth and the cloth touching the air.

2020-03-27T06:06:31Z,"Koreans wear masks because of the air pollution they have until now, not just because of the virus . that&#39;s the reason why they have these massive skincare products because the air can make you look 2x old."

There is a fixed day for buying at the end of the resident registration number. Saturday can be bought by those who can&#39;t buy it on that day Mask part five is administered by the pharmacy.  So almost all Koreans can buy masks without hoarding them. What&#39;s important is that healthy Koreans buy their own masks (purchased) and low income earners or senior citizens. It is to give way to the medical team. Make, use, and donate at home. Korean people pick up all the trash after the rally. Corona goes to Daegu to volunteer. In the end, Korea is overcoming the Korona with a high sense of citizenship."

2020-03-27T03:29:43Z,"Unknown infectious Diseases are everywhere happening everyday in the world you never know when it happens around you (new diseases are always developing new forms unknown to human in the beginning anytime anywhere) !!!! Such as the one &quot;H1N1 virus&quot; happened in USA , ignorant by all americans in the beginning in 2009, having killed 284500 people in USA, Canada &amp; all over the world.  However, Very much surprised and weird that the West inclined to get excited and like to report in a very high profile when problems concerning other countries &quot;natural challenges&quot; such as this one happening in China now.<br><br><br>Now this time more and more Flu patients have been discovered to be Covid19 patients after more Covid 19 tests are conducted on these Flu patients in USA and Europe and other parts of the world.<br><br><br>Then recently just since Last year &quot;s Flu season, more than 10000000 infected (In USA, most doctors never conducted Coronavirus Test for patients infected with Flu because patients are needed to pay thousands of dollars) while 5000 people died of Flu / pneumonia related diseases in USA alone (probably some of these deaths are caused by Covid19). More than 100 thousands people (particularly old people) died in other countries in the West (all over whole Europe, particularly Italy, France, Germany, Iran, Korea, Japan ) or in the world for Pneumonia infectious related diseases, but west media reported such diseases or sickness in a very low profile.<br><br><br><br><br><br>This is simply just a new type of Pneumonia (ie. Caused by so called corona virus) recently discovered in China, so no strange and be calm and have confidence on the highly efficiently mobilized and action centralised Chinese Government which have great knowledge and experience able to handle such natural challenges of New Pneumonia (Corona virus) in a really professional way like other similar incidents happened before internationally. Such as China &quot;s ability to mobilize all Chinese citizens, medical staff from the military, all civil servants and etc to fight against this virus invasion in the way to fight against foreign invasion wars of any kinds.<br><br><br><br>In fact, though it might be a little unfortunate for China, yet it can give a good chance for China to have a full practical national training in fighting against a war similar to biological terrorism attacks from China &quot;s hostile Super opponents. Salute to those medical professionals and other people in other sectors work together in China and other parts or the world to fight against this natural challenges and they can overcome all difficulties facing them. After overcoming this new natural challenges again, I would believe that China would have great confidence to become the most sophisticated nation in handling all kinds of new developing infectious diseases happening all over the world everyday.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Cheer to all Chinese people and their outstandingly centralized Govt having stood calm, then with immediate remedial actions taken since the outbreak of these new discovered virus !!! Just 16 years ago, the Chinese Govt united together with all their 1.4 billions patriotic citizens had overcome the SARS challenges very well, this time for sure they can handle this Less Critical natural challenges. Let us just pray for those who have suffered from this New Pneumonia and try to help each other to prevent from any kinds of diseases happened in any countries in the world !!!   <br><br><br><br>Every country has a chance (maybe next turn is your country) to have new kinds of diseases infected and spreading around the world, so never complain others but show your help if you so wish or just show your sympathy by heart if you are busy instead of spreading rumors against a country which is now nationally busy in taking the natural challenges !!!! Let us pray if you are Christian !!! Amen !!!"

There are no mass testing of people. The difference is that the Japanese people wear mask to prevent infecting the other people even before coronavirus came. Anyone who feels sick automatically wear mask. Everyone does it so the spread of the virus has been minimized in Japan even without government intervention. That is impressive.
2020-03-27T10:02:24Z,@@user-94avsf-smdk26 I don&#39;t think so. The Japanese are wearing face masks more than the South Koreans. That is already in their culture.

2020-03-28T13:52:35Z,"I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s about supply and demand (Economics 101). In South Korea, they already wear masks quite a bit because of pollution and some wear it for fashion as well. Masks are a norm so there was already a market with people willing to buy it, so they&#39;ll already have more masks. In America, very few people wore masks before the outbreak. Few people wanted them so there were few in stock to be sold. Also, it&#39;s about the response to the pandemic. In America, many downplayed the virus in the early stages and didn&#39;t stock up on masks or testing kits. Therefore, once Americans started needing masks, there already was a shortage. South Korea was prepared before the worst of the pandemic hit and were able to flatten the curve while the US is trying to catch up as it gets worse."

However, from the very nature of covid 19, it&#39;s very difficult to block all the possibilities of infection. In that sense, we can say the goddess of good fortune smiled to the people living in the above areas. In the early stage, S.Korea also took the same path. Unfortunately, however, there happened to arise massive secondary surges in Korea. In fact, such emergence could be said so natural in a populated country like South Korea. Any way, Korea is successfully coping with this secondary surge. That&#39;s why Korea is praised as truly great. They are turning out to be successful conquers who control over that bad turning point BEYOND GOOD LUCK.  Yes. They are truly qualified to be called the model of the world."

The president, Jae-In Moon, didn&#39;t obstruct people from China entering Korea at all, because not only him but also the government people thought that the policy would lower their image from China and related countries. Also he encouraged people to say the name&#39;corona virus&#39;, not &#39;Uh wan(Chinese) virus&#39;.

2020-03-26T11:59:22Z,"One lesson to all westerners: wear mask in public 100% all the time! Look at China&#39;s 31 other Provinces, Singapore, Japan, S. Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, etc., very near to the epicenter of the outbreak with high tourism travels between countries and yet the virus spread is controlled and not that high compared to the West. Climate and humidity are not the big factor as Beijing, S. Korea among other regions is also colder like the west BUT the common denominator is:<br>- public wearing of masks<br><br>This covid-19 is a respiratory disease and primarily transmitted via respiratory droplets and saliva. Everytime a person speaks fine saliva droplets are ejected, nevermind sneezing and coughing. An asymptomatic person unknowingly spreads the virus this way, by just mere talking inside subway, elevator, bus, airplane, close rooms, etc. Those droplets can be inhaled or ingested by unsuspecting person closeby. Another route is when those droplets land on surfaces such as handles, food items, packaging, tables, etc. Unsuspecting person can catch that virus via direct contact on contaminated surfaces. Westerners are taught washing of hands is more important to prevent catching the virus. However, wearing mask is a good preventive measure from catching the virus through inhalation or ingestion. It also prevents the ejection of the virus from the mouth (saliva droplets) in asymptomatic and infected person. It also prevents someone from unnecessarily touching the nose and mouth from unwashed hands in public. People normally touch their faces subconsciously."

2020-03-26T11:48:55Z,Okay wearing masks helped S. Korea flattening the curve but the most important reason is that their government started “free” wide spread testing. That’s why we see such a big gap in numbers compared to here in US. South Korea also started drive thru testing for the first time.

2020-03-26T08:57:53Z,"If you are in a sparse area, without mask still ok. Afterall you&#39;d need a lot of masks if this epidemic is gonna last a few mths. However, if you are in overcrowded within 2 m of each other, then it makes sense to put on a mask because either yourself or the person next to you is asymptomatic and you didn&#39;t know, neither does that person. I think in East Asia, people are already wearing them even in normal situation when they are sick or against pollution would just find it a normal extension of their lives but in western countries, it&#39;d take a lot of convincing, as you can see even enforcers like police officers aren&#39;t wearing. That explains the flattening out of the curve in the east asian countries, other than rapid testing, contact tracing by using their advanced technology, and isolation/quarantine of people away from their population. This is played out in S Korea, Taiwan, HK and Singapore. What they are facing now is a possible 2nd wave - imported infection from people coming back from the USA and Europe. This may also be played out in USA/Europe after your long battle with the 1st wave, depending on how whether this pandemic is contained in most countries by then."

2020-03-26T07:58:47Z,"Misinfo in this report here. Mass testing? it was only done in specific areas where the virus spread. Non near the areas I lived (though there is a separate line to call if you had any symptoms of the virus, you are told NOT to visit any local hospitals in case of infecting others and use the call line instead for separate testing). Masks are in limited supply and Korean govt got a lot of heat because they sent millions to China while the people here didn&#39;t have enough (produce 10m a day while pop is 50m+). And because there weren&#39;t enough to go around, the Govt is now backtracking from telling the public originally of replace the mask once per day to once every few days (Why not show the ppl waiting in line trying to buy masks? it was all over the news in KR, though subsided now). There are alerts via SMS but only after the person infected is confirmed and txts out the locations of where he/she has been. The only spike happened in Daegu (southside of Korea) due to the stupid  mass gatherings in a cult-like church. People are well educated enough about wearing masks even when there isn&#39;t a virus going around because of all the god damn smog coming from China. Koreans are mad because the govt didn&#39;t close immigration/visitations from China when the crisis started, Trump took swift action on that at least. Panic buying happened in specific areas, but it was mainly masks not water. Most people in Korea has a private water filtration system in their homes + bidets (it&#39;s 2020 people, why would you wipe your own ass and get shitstains when you can use water pumped up there to clean it instead)"

Tesing is really important because chances of virus spread is much higher at initial stage and non crital symptoms. Here in US, insurance company think of money only and so many people do not have insurance. So hard to get tested even."

If we all have minimal altruism and community spirit, we can keep our freedom with minimal control. And keep in mind that your uncontrolled freedoms can harm others. If you are infected with a virus, inform your neighbors of your route. The information you provided will be of great help to your neighbors. If there is someone who has given you information, thank you and comfort him. Wear a mask if you have no choice but to go out.

2020-03-26T01:31:14Z,Its going to get way worse in the next few months.  I don&#39;t think the U.S. has the supplies/man power/mindset to make this turn around as fast as Korea did.  Its going to take some pretty bad devastation to really put it into peoples minds to take care of this seriously.  Our own government is confused on what to do at times and isn&#39;t implementing the steps that Korea did wholeheartedly.  Good luck out there guys and just stay home and away from others best you can until this thing settles down.

I think everyone should wear masks esp going to restock on grocery shopping, or getting takeout food, get gas for the car.

2020-03-25T16:50:33Z,Why wouldn&#39;t CDC recommend people to put on masks everyday?  They say to wear it only if you believe you have signs of Corona virus.  Wouldn&#39;t it be better to be precautious by wearing the mask before you get infected from others or to spread?  CDC just don&#39;t want the society to panic.  But average people need to protect themselves before it happens.  Washing hands is good but putting a mask on is MUST.

2020-03-25T11:38:59Z,"In Korea, mask are used to protect themselves, as there are possibilities if the infected person meet with other people without knowing he or she was infected. However, in Western countries including U.S., it seems that people have a strong sense of negative view of people wearing masks, because they think the people wearing masks are sick. <br>As a Korean, I think you should change your perception of people wearing masks. Wearing masks is not only for sick people. It should be also used to protect yourselves."
2020-03-25T11:34:56Z,"Until last week, we were crazy at buying masks (which you can buy two piece for every week with your id card in pharmacy) like it’s the only way to protect yourself from infection and respectful to people around you, Now most of the people have enough masks that there are only 5-6 people in front of the pharmacy waiting for their turn. I know in many other cultures, the perception about the people whose wearing a mask is not positive, but you guys should know it’s The most important way to protect yourself and people of your country. There was one case in Korea at the beginning who confirmed Corona Virus after visiting China, this guy wore a mask all the time even inside if his house when he was with his family and relatives, No one was infected thanks to his efforts of protection. We know it’s super inconvenient to breathe, smelly, hard to talk and communicate with people, but it made Koreans and their community to be safer. Plz wear mask, if it’s hard to buy, make one by your own. I wish all the other countries to be safe and healthy."

2020-03-25T10:41:41Z,Wear a mask. It works. There&#39;s no confinement in Korea because everyone is wearing mask. You can go anywhere and meet anyone without fearing to get infected as long as you&#39;re wearing mask. If it&#39;s impossible to get a mask in your country try to find a substitute and at least try to cover your mouth and nose. Infection is all about the chances and you have to try your best to lower the chances.
2020-03-27T22:08:32Z,The moment someone touches that mask he or she is going to be infected. Also mask dont last more than a few hours. The real deal is being able to track the infected. The masks are just a plus.

2020-03-25T06:42:57Z,"When we have free rapid covid-19 testing in the USA, when I see people wearing masks in public regardless of wether they are sick or not, when the USA has masks for everyone, it will be encouraging. Currently we do not even have enough masks for our healthcare workers."
2020-03-25T06:41:09Z,"As a Korean American, I have a question. Why does US medical insurance costs more than 10 times that of Korean insurance?"
2020-03-25T06:59:56Z,korean insurance = government. American insurance = corporates backed up by politicians who is behind lobbiest
2020-03-25T06:35:34Z,wear masks!!!!
2020-03-25T06:26:49Z,"Koreans are all donating voluntarily to help people in situations that are harder than I am. Food and masks are donated for the medical staff. And if the condition is not critical even if you have corona, you voluntarily go to an isolation facility to have someone who is sicker than me get treatment first. That is the reason for not causing medical panic and the death rate is lower than that of Italy or China. <br>Koreans have done so historically. Many people voluntarily sacrificed their lives to return my country&#39;s name to the people when it was ruled by Japan. They didn&#39;t want any reward, and there was a Korean flag in their hearts.<br>When my grandmother was young, she saw a seven-year-old child being shot by a Japanese being for using Korean. Koreans have always prepared to defend their country at the expense of my life in times of war.<br>And <br>when I saw foreigners without masks, I thought it would be harder to buy masks than Koreans, so I gave him my mask <br>Korea&#39;s founding ideology is &quot;Help Human to the Far Away.&quot;<br>This means constantly trying to help others."

2020-03-25T05:30:22Z,"I&#39;m South Korean, and I hated wearing masks in the beginning. I thought people are just way too sensitive about the issue or something, but now I wear them, too. We were kinda like America in the beginning, and the government also told people just like Trump &quot;it is not a big deal&quot;, and then we had a mass infection from a religious group of people, and the situation got escalated very quickly. We are not blocking any other countries right now which I do not understand. We got more benefits from nurses and doctors who are working so hard for patients, the government is taking advantage of their effort."

2020-03-25T06:52:41Z,"@@vdvehe4044 yes but the only reason is crowded is that the country is smaller in size compared with Canada that has a less amount of people in in its country compared to Korea, and second if you look at the charts do United States is the only country that spends more than 500 billion dollars than any other country on the military."

2020-03-25T04:08:48Z,Koreans give a wary look to people who don’t wear mask in public. It is opposite in many other countries..this should be changed.
2020-03-25T03:57:32Z,Masks help a bit.  Helps avoid touching your nose and mouth accidentally while out and about.  But most importantly since you could be a potential carrier with no symptoms it definitely helps the spread of the virus.
2020-03-25T03:57:31Z,"Of course it&#39;s common courtaesy, that&#39;s all. Wearing mask is not only infected but also normal people have to wear the mask for others and unexpected situations."

2020-03-25T03:44:03Z,"Taiwan locked downed their country &quot;FROM CHINA&quot; and have less than 100 confirmed cases so far. In South Korea, about 100 cases are diagnosed a single day. The only difference is that they have Chai as the leader and we Moon. Moon emphatically refused people&#39;s demand to close our borders to China over and over again, because to him, China is such a good friend that he can never close a door to.  The funny part is that after slowing down of their infection, the Chinese close THEIR border TO South Koreans. Guess it&#39;s the end of a beautiful friendship."

In SK, when they know where is the red spot, they lock that area. If you’re at home, they’ll bring their nurses to take you go straight to the quarantine place so you don’t spread the virus. Everybody, don’t care old or young people, they all where mask. That’s why right now the only thing they lack of is mask not foods, water or toilet papers. Here you wait to it becomes serious then you wear mask. Does anybody know that this virus start at the end of December? Our President was like” No worry” at that time.

People wear masks in South Korea and we should too. It reduces  risk of getting other people sick. We are not advising people to wear masks because we are short in supply. Right now, we need them primarily for health care professionals. 2. The South Korean healthcare system is run by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and is free to all citizens at the point of delivery. The system is funded by a compulsory National Health Insurance Scheme that covers 97% of the population. So if they want to get tested, they will get it. This is an important factor,  We need to identify problem areas and that can only be determined by testing as many people as possible. Again, we are not advising people to take test unless they have symptoms. Our healthcare system may not be capable of handling all confirmed patients, especially at this growing rate and at this stage. Overall, we are doing our best but I just want to point out that our healthcare system isn&#39;t designed to follow the same path."
2020-03-24T23:36:30Z,"Please, wear a mask! Wearing a mask is not a weird thing."
2020-03-24T23:32:41Z,"Oh now its good to wear masks. :^)<br>I&#39;m glad I had a good mask supply from cosplaying last year. <br>And everyone was laughing at me for wearing it.  <br>Now look all of you, freaking out to buy masks :D"
2020-03-24T23:31:56Z,In Asia during the flu seasons they wear mask all the time. So they are used to it. In America u wear mask they say your sick. Mask helps you not touch your face and your nose. Incase people who are coughing the mask helps you not to catch the cough.
2020-03-24T23:21:11Z,Is it true that China produced covid-19?
2020-03-24T23:14:48Z,Here on Long Island they refuse to test anyone
2020-03-24T23:09:02Z,Korea are best
2020-03-24T22:51:16Z,It is necessary to change the perception of wearing a mask.
2020-03-24T22:47:32Z,"Also there is no Trump in South Korea. South Korean President, president Moon, used to be a human rights lawyer before becoming a president. So he has a deep understanding for humanity unlike Trump."

2020-03-24T22:53:05Z,because it has been encouraged by the government. Also nobody cares about wearing a mask even in the bank. Masking is not that a big deal since they have been affecting by fine dust from China.
2020-03-24T22:38:25Z,How did they  get so many test kits so fast
2020-03-24T22:24:54Z,"Also NO ONE in South Korea is panic buying. There is no long line in front of supermarkets and no one is hoarding anything. All the shelves at supermarkets are filled with food and toilet papers. Since no one is running around&amp; panic buying, no one feels the need to do so and there is always full of food and stuffs available at supermarkets. They are living like normal human beings even in this kind of crisis. Meanwhile in US people are fighting over toilet papers"
2020-03-25T10:50:21Z,There&#39;s no need for panic buying because there&#39;s no confinement in Korea. People can go out anywhere and meet anyone. It&#39;s all because everyone is wearing masks and also because we have trust on our medical system.
2020-03-25T12:43:13Z,That’s because Koreans are nice and have standards

2020-03-24T22:24:39Z,America is cheap! Take your tax dollars and have other ideas without you in mind!
2020-03-24T22:22:53Z,"First thing first. So Korea has socialized healthcare, with free testing for all.  Those tested positive were isolated and treated.  Meantime, everyone wears masks to everywhere, and everywhere is constantly sanitized.  On the flip side in the USA, testing is limited and not free.  Everyone is to stay at home and hope of not being infected.  Should you get l sick, you are not to congest the healthcare facility, and possibly contaminate others, so you are to phone your doctor for advice.  Your doctor will determine whether you will be seen and if you are  qualify to be tested.  Should you be tested and found to be positive, and the cost of treatment will be determine by what type of insurance you have, and should you have no insurance, be prepare to get a bill for the treatment cost."
2020-03-24T22:22:39Z,Yeah let’s get CCTV and really be tracked all the time! Great idea ABC 👍🏻 ... you SUCK!
2020-03-24T22:21:18Z,South Korea is approximately the size of one state in the US.  That should put the onus on each governor to follow S. Korea&#39;s template.  Maybe Coumo should follow their lead.
2020-03-24T22:05:32Z,"Masks are now easily accessible in korea because they have productions there and also cut down masks exports down to 10% so that national people can have access to it. And they are good masks, N95, hospital grade masks controlled and supplied by South Korean government so that market sellers can sell them with overly increased price and everyone can easily get access to it from national post offices over the nations. <br>Everyone lets take this seriously and stay home. We can do it together !!"
2020-03-24T22:03:20Z,"Bad math.  Relevant number would be cases per million population.  Much closer rates,   US has 6.5 times as many population but only 5 times the cases, of S Korea.  A Better number would be deaths per person over 50.  <br>Apparently they were however better prepared to act quickly.  <br>This is understandable.  Small and autocratic beats large and diffuse, Shared authority for a speedy response.  <br>No republican / Democratic political nonsense to slow things down.  <br>Sun Tzu said it.

2020-03-24T21:47:27Z,"its necessary to take in consideration that s korea had an epidemic outbreak not long ago, who pushed them to reach WHO to learn what measures to implement, they are also culturly acostumed to witness outbreaks in the neighborings countries. for example, china had the sars outbreak not so long ago either"
2020-03-24T21:44:33Z,"President Trump called S.

2020-03-24T21:31:52Z,"THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT<br>CORONA VIRUS ALERT<br><br>I NEED YOU TO SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE AND TELL THEM TO SHARE IT WITH EVERYONE TOO. THE AUTHORITIES DON&#39;T REALLY WANT TO HELP YOU, THEY JUST WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU BY USING THE SITUATION TO BE YOUR &#39;PROTECTOR&#39;S&#39;<br><br>Help me put an end to this ridiculous situation. I&#39;ve been emailing the following around to as many people as I can. Please join my army against the corona virus and together lets put an end to this, before your or my family becomes the next victim. Just share the hell out of the following text:<br><br>&quot;This corona virus thing is getting ridiculous now. Instead of making everybody shut themselves away, what the govt should be advising is what I&#39;ve been doing for the last few days and have been trying to encourage others to do as well. whenever I go out I simply carry with me a refillable spray bottle and a cloth and fill the bottle with disinfectant or bleach solution. Then whenever I use a door handle or press a button,use an ATM or something, I use the cloth which I spray regularly enough to keep damp. This way not only am I unlikely to pick up the virus but I&#39;m also creating uninhabitable areas on the handles and buttons where the virus can&#39;t survive. But I&#39;m just one person and don&#39;t make much difference alone. But imagine if they encouraged 50% of the public to do the same? The handles, buttons and other things handled the most by the public, the ones that are most likely enabling the virus to spread to the most people, would be the most inhospitable for the virus to live. Because all the bleach left on there by all those people would be killing its ability to survive and spread considerably, so much so that the figures of new cases would most likely drop to barely any at all.<br><br>And this is such a simple thing that could be so effective. I already emailed several newspapers and tv news about this but they&#39;ve not mentioned it once, it seems they&#39;re more interested in scaring people as much as possible. Instead of fearmongering and telling everyone to hide away at home like scared little sheep totally reliant on their &#39;shepards&#39; for protection and guidance, they should be telling everybody to do this simple but effective idea. Everyday printing it and showing it on tv. So people can get on with their lives and all of us together can do our own little bit towards fighting this virus as a community. Working strongly together instead of dividing us up and hiding us away like scared little rabbits while this virus just continues to spread through all the millions of buttons and handles around the world.<br><br>I&#39;m sure you know that one person with this virus only has to cough into his hand just before opening a door or pressing a button or something, and then the next five or ten people that come after him will most likely come down with it too, or at least they will go and spread it to anything else they touch afterwards. The people of the world are your best soldiers to fight this. Please just do whatever you can to help me recruit them all, and lets see the end of this disease sooner rather than later. Before one of yours or my family becomes one of the next victims. Please tell everyone you can, and tell them to tell everyone, and tell them to tell everyone to tell everyone. Lets get this simple idea going now before its too late. The governments could even put refill stations in busy areas like shopping centres and train stations etc.<br><br>Thank you and good luck in these trying times.&quot;<br><br>===============================================<br>-Remember guys, Man is the apex predator, Man is the most dangerous living organism this planet has ever seen. We kill way more than any other animal, bacteria or disease has ever done. But we need to start acting like it if we are going to beat this thing. Not hide away scared.<br><br>Simple solutions are often the most effective. so get yourself some bleach or disinfectant solution and get out there and do your bit. its your duty as a human being really.<br>And share this now like you&#39;ve never shared anything in your life, because your life, and many others especially the old and your children, may depend on it.<br><br>SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE NOW.<br><br><br>Please if you speak another language translate and share to help protect your country."

2020-03-24T21:25:05Z,"What S.Korea have been doing is a test and quarantine,  track down all possible exposed people and test them all! Also, the government clearly open all the information showing how many test had been conducted, number of confirmed people, mortality rate, as well as where the covid 19 infected person had been visited. Which is not happening in the US."
2020-03-24T21:21:34Z,"What this news report is missing: South Korea is failing on social distancing. Coffee places are crowded, and some of the concert halls had 1,000 attendees, just a few days ago. With infected people flowing in from abroad, their numbers will spike again if they do not enforce strict social distancing now. Yes, stay-at-home orders do cause inconveniences and financial difficulties, but I feel much safer where everyone is required (not simply encouraged as in South Korea) to stay at home."

It covers people’s mouths and noses where the viru<br><br><br>s could come out and can effectively prevent the virus from being spread out . It is  a kind of isolation between individuals. If everybody covers the mouth and nose the virus will have no way to come out the mouths and noses. China, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan they are all successful in containing the virus . They used different tactics but one thing in common is that everybody wears masks in their countries . Everybody Wearing masks is the main reason for their success."

Our population is much larger and our land mass is much much larger. We are very spread out. The main issue in the states is the availability of test kits. Our private companies are now producing more masks and ventilators so hopefully scarcity of those wont be an issue.

2020-03-24T20:34:43Z,"Hi, guys<br>I&#39;m a Korean, who currently studying in state of virginia. <br>I don&#39;t understand why you guys have hoards of toilet papers, bottles of water, eggs, and other necessities. <br>Why can&#39;t you guys let doctors, nurses, or other people use first, who are elders or physically disabled?<br>I just don&#39;t get it?!?! <br>In Korea, we still have plenty of toilet papers, fruits, vegetables, bottles of water, and other types of cleaning tools. <br>And, why don&#39;t you guys have masks on?<br>I think every one of you guys should have masks on, and there should be a driving thru inspection, for every states, or even every counties in the country. <br>I was amazed by how ignorance some of you have, by making Jokes with corona virus, or don&#39;t even think this is going to be a big deal."

2020-03-24T20:31:42Z,Time to go to south korea
2020-03-24T20:30:59Z,"I am Korean. Everyone, Plz. wear a mask! We can stop the virus from spreading. South Korea, Japan, and the Chinese must wear masks. Don&#39;t buy toilet paper and buy a mask that the money. Helps prevent viral particles in the air. Why would medical staff wear masks? Actually I know it&#39;s hard to get masks because there&#39;s no manufacturing in the U.S. or Europe. Then make a cotton mask at home using your old clothes!! Although it is less effective than n95 (kf 94), it can prevent the other person&#39;s saliva. Don&#39;t look at Asians wearing masks with an abhorrent look, please make a mask and use it. And you can make and use hand sanitizer. Medical alcohol and aloe gel. It&#39;s simple. All the instructions are on YouTube, so please. The start of each small prevention can prevent the health of your country&#39;s people and prevent infection from spreading. Make sure you don&#39;t go out unnecessary. Your family is safe only when you are safe! ㅡp.s : Keep in mind that there may be mistranslations using translators. :)"

2020-03-24T20:28:16Z,"They take quarantine very seriously and stay at home. They don&#39;t go grocery shopping every few days, they get things delivered if they can, wear masks if they go out, let their government track people who are infected (even after they are better). While we are so concerned about privacy issues when we are in the midst of a crisis. What&#39;s the priority?! They also have enough test kits for people. 10,000 test per day in south korea vs 250 test per day here. We function like a third world country and our president thinks that we&#39;re okay?! How dare he think that we can go back to &#39;normal&#39; in 2 weeks with this current situation."

2020-03-24T19:44:03Z,Yet here in America we’re highly discouraged from wearing masks UNLESS we are symptomatic 🤦🏻‍♀️. Idk what to believe anymore. Im starting to doubt we really even have a shortage on masks.... i just don’t know how to trust our faulty government.

2020-03-24T19:42:02Z,I think the real issue is currency. How long does the virus last on paper money and coins? Everyone is paying and receiving change. I would only use debit or credit cards
2020-03-24T19:41:56Z,Finally Trump called South Korea President for help!!!

2020-03-24T19:35:12Z,Taiwan is the role model of fighting against the coronavirus for all the countries around the world
2020-03-25T05:08:55Z,Taiwan did good but we cant compare other countries to Tawian the population and the size is very small. They never had high infection in the first place. Korea had a lot of infected ppl in the begining and fixed the problem
2020-03-28T03:10:30Z,"slifer 4195 Because Taiwan made a decision to ban the travellers from China before the coronavirus becomes pandemic, they took action quicker than all of the other countries.  They are the only place to take action to prevent the coronavirus before it became pandemic, unlike all other countries took action after it became pandemic including South Korea, Japan and all western countries."
2020-03-28T03:21:37Z,"@@richardbrown5784 Korea never banned any borders. Including from china. Tawian did good, but tawian is 3 times smaller than a tiny country korea. Its method would be hard to apply in US thats like 100 times bigger than korea and 300 times bigger than tawian. Besides according to data from airport, more cases are coming from US and europe now so rly u have to block every country if u gonna block one country. This was spreading since september"
2020-03-24T19:34:44Z,"When Bruce Lee speaks, you listen. Also, I have been saying that everyone should wear a mask (sick or not) to begin with, maybe not an N95 but at least a surgical mask or even a scarf. It will help prevent asymptomatic ppl from spewing virus droplets into the air or onto surfaces. It&#39;s also getting to be peak allergy season so there is a strong chance of uncontrollable sneezing."

2020-03-24T19:17:42Z,"Wear masks masks. Even no surgical masks, just a cloth also helps. If everyone(including the asymptomatic virus carriers) wears masks, most of the droplets will be contained inside the masks. It’s a must in a crowded area like subway, all ppl must wear masks."
2020-03-24T19:14:53Z,Trump didn&#39;t take the disease seriously when it started emerging in the U.S. He even thought that it would be over in a few days.

2020-03-24T19:13:46Z,"I am Korean and the biggest problem here in United States is that we are encourage not to wear masks. I understand we don&#39;t really have enough masks here so we need to start making them. Also stop telling people only people should wear masks are those who got the virus or have symptoms, we got to make everyone wear them so it doesn&#39;t spread. Lot of times Coronavirus don&#39;t even have symptoms so this is another reason why everyone need to wear them."
2020-03-24T19:10:56Z,"In S.Korea also didn&#39;t care if you didn&#39;t have the symptoms, they were like &#39;come get tested&#39; But doctors here literally refuse to test ppl. I understand that you don&#39;t want the hospitals flooded, but the US is NOT Italy. Italy is a more tourist area.

And even the Chinese don&#39;t believe the data released by the Chinese government.<br>On the other hand, Korea released all the information. And the Korean government demanded maximum cooperation from its citizens and made immediate quarantine and treatment.<br>Why do the media call the actions of the Korean government and citizens a democratic success? Transparent disclosure of information, immediate response, and a high level of civic awareness."

You can also prevent infection by washing or disinfecting your hands very frequently. Almost all closed facilities in Korea are equipped with free hand sanitizers. In Korea, illegal immigrants can also get a free test if they come into contact with patients. The government has allowed hospitals not to report to the immigration office."

My mom goes to the medical equipment market and buys tubes, bedding, and other medical thing that is needed for him. and gives it to the hospital for them to use on my stepfather. instead of the hospital charging what every they went for that product. and the population is 1/7 of the US population."

2020-03-24T16:42:17Z,"First, let me tell you that I&#39;m South Korean.<br><br>Some people argue that if you have symptoms, you&#39;re staying at home without going out, and why are you wearing a mask? But the scary thing about this covid-19 is that it has no symptoms like fever or coughing, but it&#39;s possible it&#39;s positive. So we recommend that not only the medical staff but also the public wear masks. Then I can prevent it from passing on to others when I&#39;m sick without even realizing it. Then again, some people will argue, taking issue with the lack of masks. <br><br>Yes, it is. In fact, the current amount of masks in Korea is not enough to be distributed to all Koreans. That is why the Korean government is taking the approach of purchasing all goods produced by various mask factories and distributing them to the public through pharmacies. And people are donating free of charge to medical institutions if they are judged to have a rather generous amount of masks (All surgical masks produced in Korea are distributed to medical institutions). This is how the mask market is now in Korea.<br><br>In conclusion, wearing a mask is one of the fundamental ways to solve this situation. Thank you for reading. I hope you have a safe and happy day."

Yeah, we have our fair share of idiots who still hold large church group ceremonies or hang out at clubs on Fridays, since our government did not prohibit such activites. Yet, here now in SK, some local governments are now issuing orders to prohibit such clustering of people at their(local government&#39;s) own discretion. These orders are not by the central government. It means we do not try to limit people&#39;s freedom unless we have exhausted other measures first."

2020-03-24T16:13:27Z,Please stay strong US.
2020-03-24T16:13:02Z,Why Doesn’t South Korea send us their damn masks then?!
2020-03-24T17:56:18Z,what is wrong with you? of course they need the masks for themselves. every country is short of masks these days  you idiot.

2020-03-24T16:12:37Z,"...except the population of the US is far greater at 327.2 million (2018) than South Korea at 51.47 million (2017) and that should be reflected proportionately by a higher infection rate which it is. Do the math yourself <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries"">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries</a> . What is more since the disease spreads exponentially, not linearly, the numbers shouldn&#39;t even be as proportional as they are. The US should have much more, and probably will.<br><br>I really don&#39;t think people should be so eager for widespread government tracking.

2020-03-24T16:07:00Z,We all are focused on Mask wearing as a be all end all.  And yes this is one part but people just cuz you wear a mask and ask others to do so won’t be the only thing necessary.  <br><br>Cultural change in this United States needs to occur.   To much “Me and I” not enough “We and US.”   <br><br>I mean for #%$&amp; sake our own initials of our country spell US.   Maybe we can all take a more enlightened view and participate in the collective and pull off our individual blinders.   <br><br>Be mindful of our surrounds and of others and if we take best care of what we can control then collectively differences can be made.  <br><br>Stop focusing on what others are not doing and what you are doing and maybe we can fix more than just COVID-19.

We&#39;ve been getting the same message here in Canada about limiting the use of them, but really there&#39;s just a shortage. I agree that we must prioritize our frontline workers right now, but if you look it up, individuals everywhere have been amazing about sewing their own! I&#39;ve provided a link to an article about the effectiveness of everyday materials (overall, a plain old cotton t-shirt is one of the best choices due to its ability to capture about 50% of particles and its breathability) and another link to an article with patterns for a simple homemade mask. There are lots of YouTube videos too.<br><br>I&#39;m Japanese-Canadian so I&#39;m well-aware of the cultural differences between East and West. Part of the western world&#39;s scattered response has definitely been because we&#39;re so individualistic here.

We have to roll up our sleeves and take it upon ourselves to come up with solutions. I&#39;ve been as disappointed as everyone else about our lacklustre political leadership...it&#39;s up to us.

2020-03-24T15:59:32Z,The thing is that South Koreans are still struggling with wrong strategies by government. Masks are hard to get. They have to be in a long line to get 2 masks. The reality appears to be different. The one thing that made South Korea strong is that Koreans cooperate and self-isolate themselves to overcome this as a society while Americans tend to behave more individualistically.
2020-03-24T18:00:37Z,every country is short of masks these days  you idiot. what can the government do when all the people want them at the same time? I heard that many people in Korea are grateful for what the government has been doing.
2020-03-24T18:33:46Z,@P S many other countries are praising your country now for what your government has been done and you are not satisfied?? you guys should be grateful at least for this corona situation. just look at other countries. which one is doing better?

2020-03-24T15:56:25Z,The US has not had a culture of wearing masks like Asian country&#39;s so yes they already had masks at home unlike here were you would have been laughed at for wearing one. Also Obama was the one that dropped the ball  and cut funding for national preparedness. One more thing South Korea 80 million people US 320 million that would have had a fit at first if told to stay home. Thankfully we catch  on fast and are getting up to speed very quickly.

2020-03-24T15:52:15Z,South Korea is testing everyone whether they have symptoms or not.. the US is very selective in testing and that’s why the cases are only increasing

2020-03-24T15:47:55Z,You have to remember how south Korea tracked all their people like that isn&#39;t even legal here. Also their mask supply is a LOT more abundant due to cultural differences between us and them. If you watch them in day to day life a significant portion of the population wear masks no matter what really.
2020-03-25T02:00:42Z,Light Yagami they don’t track all their people. That’s not legal there either. They only get their cell phone location history for those who tested positive so that they know where these people have been to go target deep cleaning and sanitization and to let the public know not to go near those areas or warn them of possible exposure to the virus.
2020-03-24T15:47:23Z,hevent seen 1 toilet paper roll

2020-03-24T15:41:24Z,How about all the sanitizing they did in the streets and on public transportation? I&#39;m sure that helped in the slowing down of spread.  These are the same people who lived through SARS a few years back and learned a little something about controlling a contagion.

If there is an infected person around your house, tell me where and where the infected person went on your cell phone. That way, people can be more careful on their own. As far as I know, Maxist politicians and governments don&#39;t disclose important information to the people. I heard that the U.S. is not open to the public and the opportunity to be tested is difficult. So the U.S. government is a Maximist?"
2020-03-24T15:30:40Z,"Already many media have seen the actions of the Korean government and its people and say that it is a success of democracy, but do you think you are incapable of distinguishing democracy from socialism?"
2020-03-24T15:33:02Z,"In fact, an infected person who had a virus in Korea could not carry the virus to his family and colleagues while wearing a mask in every life. Koreans wear masks for themselves, but for their family and colleagues. Don&#39;t you feel anything from the high level of citizenship of Koreans?"
2020-03-24T15:17:57Z,"South Korean version of CDC who prepared all these by simulating possible outbreak like Corona virus was established by an order of former president Roh mu hyun who was a life long partner and friend of current president Moon Jaein. Do you remember a ferry boarded more than 300 students was sunken in 2014? The patrol who got there first didn&#39;t order leaving the ship because they were busy with reporting the situation to the president who now impeached and in prison Park Geun  Hye, which resulted most of students drowned to death. It&#39;s all about who has been leading the country and prepared system. I&#39;m pretty sure the situation in here SKorea would&#39;ve been not much different or worse than other countries if there weren&#39;t presidents like Roh and Moon. It&#39;s all about politics.

2020-03-24T14:00:51Z,"COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus)<br><br>&quot;If you have a strong immune system, you do not have to worry about contracting the Coronavirus.&quot;<br><br>FALSE<br><br>If you have a &quot;strong immune system&quot;, your immune system can overreact, and attack lymphocyte cells, which leads to, among the list of more commonly known symptoms, heart palapatations, organ failure, and death.<br><br>&quot;It only survives outside of the host for a few days.&quot;<br><br>FALSE <br><br>Viruses can survive outside the body for up to nine days at normal temperatures - and for four weeks in cold climates. Though specific information is not yet available for the COVID-19, (Novel Coronavirus), we can assume the numbers will be very similar.<br><br>Many people who do not test positive in the initial stages, will later test positive during the progression of the incubation period.<br><br>COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus) Information:<br><br>O+ and 0- blood types are more resilient to the Coronavirus. The main distinguishable difference I can find between O+ and 0- blood types, and other blood types is, the alkaline levels in the blood are higher. The fusion of the Coronavirus occurs at a higher acidity level. So, it appears that it&#39;s important not to eat foods high in sugars, and caffeine, as they raise your acidity levels. Drinking at least 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda (a 0.1 molar solution of baking soda has a pH of about 8.3) mixed with 1 tablespoon of water (or the least amount required for the baking soda to completely dissolve in the water), and lime or lemon juice (from 1 lime or lemon which both have a ph of about 3), will help prevent Coronavirus fusion during the incubation period, thus will greatly reduce any symptoms, and speed up recovery time. Mix 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda with one tbsp (or as little as possible to ensure the baking soda dissolves) of distilled water in a glass. Mix the juice from one lime or lemon in a seperate glass, also with 1 tbsp of water (or the least amount required for the baking soda to fully dissolve in the water). Once the baking soda has dissolved, and the solution is clear, drink it. Then immediately drink the lime or lemon juice solution. A reaction will occur that kills any viruses, and even any bacteria, located in your throat. Of course, internally, you will have an alkaline pH, as opposed to an acidic pH, preventing Coronavirus Cell-fusion. This is why we do not want to overly dilute the solution with water. This mixture has been proven to lower fever, stop nasal secretions, and mucus development in the lungs, as well as treating other symptoms. This will not prevent you from contracting the coronavirus. But this will disallow the coronavirus to have an optimal acidic base, which allows Coronavirus-cell fusion. So, besides taking at least 1000 mg. vitamin C everyday, take this solution. In laments terms, The Coronavirus-cell fusion does not occur at a neutral pH. Fusion activation is a direct low ph dependent process occuring with a half maximal rate of fusion at pH 5.5. Of course, they aren&#39;t telling anyone this. As a matter of fact, Reuters is claiming this information is false, despite laboratory tests on Coronavirus-cell fusion occurring only with an acidic pH, and will not occur in an alkaline pH. This oral solution will simply prevent fusion of the Coronavirus-cells, giving you a much higher chance of having very mild symptoms, and a much faster recovery time. The more Coronavirus-cell fusion that occurs during the incubation period (the incubation period can last for 2 weeks), the more susceptible you will be to life-threatening complications. The incubation period is the time in which you contract the Coronavirus, and the time in which symptoms appear. You may not just get pneumonia, in one or both lungs, your organs can simply shut down from the Coronavirus. It&#39;s more serious than they are telling you, and it spreads easily by an infected person who displays no symptoms. It&#39;s crucial to disallow the Coronavirus-cell fusion process to occur during the incubation period. It is clear that people who suffer life-threatening complications, with exception to ashtma, and individual cases of compromised metabolic function, have a higher occurrence of Coronavirus-cell fusion, directly indicating a more acidic pH level. The death rate is not 3%. If 4 out of 7 people died from the Coronavirus, and others were hospitalized, and we keep seeing a similar trend,  ommon sense tells us the rest. I realize that we need a much broader statistical analysis to establish a more accurate percentile, so It&#39;s not going to just throw some random number out there. But their numbers are not making sense. I&#39;ve read other statistics. But it is not a 3% mortality rate, and despite what they are telling you, more people do not die from the common type A &amp; B flu virus. God be with you."

I am not predicting, I am just informing you. <br>We as one cannot die, and We will bring him/Jesus back when the time comes. It will take all to see that He/Jesus is you,  &amp; we are all his children. But here in purgatory you will fight and suffer and feel pain till you wake up and bring together the Alpha and the Omega and become one. Our bodies are so special and we have the ability to move mountains &amp; walk on water, but we put these chemicals/Florid that saturate your third eye that hold many keys to becoming who you really are, and the animals we eat that have been slaughtered have energy living cells that suffered and you your body is more special than they want you to believe. This virus is of what we caused as one and it is spreading all over the world. You are so easy to eat whatever because you were indoctrinated over thousands of years and you only know the TRUTH that is a LIE that was told to you by the Same Omega God that crucified Jesus on the cross. He is in your headbrain making us all suffer because we wants what is of this realm which is sex,money, to be wealthy and to judge your neighbors and family. <br>You turn too the Omega God the Devil and slave to him and look for him in church and saturate your soul with his consent the Devil 👿. It’s always been a Lie. He the Omega God himself is winning and is blinding you to keep you slaved and will make you suffer every day until you wake up. It’s so easy to commit sins and feel you are forgiven. Please wake up and know that we are helping him the Omega god the devil himself win this war and slave you until you wake up. I’m sure you know what is right and wrong and you will protect the Omega God himself and trash in your mind what I am telling you after you read this. That is why we are suffering every day. Time does not matter to him as we keep feeding his plate and giving him what he wants and needs.<br>The Omega/Devil will be defeated in the end. Until that time comes you will suffer and keep coming back to this realm of purgatory. You are the key and deep down inside you know what it is to be pure but still feed on his Glory and shat the real problem that is causing this pandemic. All we have to do is become one and defeat this virus and all diseases, but you have to survive in this day in age because we put ourselves in this hell. Remember that if you still fight for the ones who are controlling us like the higher up, the Omega/ God himself the devil in our souls thats Saturated with hate and judgment you will suffer and so will your loved one( the only ones you care about because that’s America and the whole world we created over time. Remember time is of nothing to him and he is feeding on this pandemic and now we are begging him for help when you as one have always been the key. You are him in his image and you will fight for this God/Devil to survive.<br>Jesus understood that and he seen how easy it was for us to sin and knew we would always be slaved by who killed him, the Omega Devil God himself the devil that has you wrapped around his finger like a puppet. Please tell me if I’m wrong??? and if I’m told a lie about Jesus too. What is true if that all I ever was told is a lie. Even God.  If I’ve been lied to then the word lie is a lie and I am nothing. And we all are nothing. And Sophia is nothing and all that is ever said is nothingness. What are we if we can’t believe in anything. <br>This virus is gonna make us either kill one another to survive as the Omega God/the devil will make you do even the army when they are called in to try and help when the public will see them as harm to there family. If we can’t understand who is really in control then we will all go down in the pits of hell and destroy what we all could fix in the blink of an eye. But we are to far gone with how the Omega god has controlled us for so long. Remember, He is the one who crucified Jesus and we went on as if it never happened and created this. Please understand that if you still feed on him he will win and we will suffer everyday. Lord please give thes souls strength to get through there pain for they do not know what they do. Amen"

2020-03-24T13:04:32Z,The west have total zero awareness about how masks works for yourselves nor others like we in Asia. The masks helps when you&#39;ve pollen or any airborne allergy or when you&#39;re sick having a flu/fever. Especially so when you&#39;re having sneezing &amp; coughing badly when you&#39;re a bad flu. This helps to stop/protect the spread to your love ones/community &amp; others. We also wear masks when air quality are bad..Wear masks that help blocks pm2.5 particles in the air going into your lungs helps yr respiratory system which may long terms cause lung cancer even if you&#39;re a non-smokers!! For this virus at least a surgical mask needed to help block respiratory droplets from landing onto others especially helps someone who is infected with no convid-19 syptoms. Whether is your public healthcare systems failed you for not educating such awarenesses to general public or it&#39;s because of your cultural mind set cause such huge virus containment to fail. Of course nothing helps if all not staying united!!
2020-03-24T13:04:22Z,You&#39;d think this type of action is easy in the US. But the government here encourages people to think it&#39;s not a big problem

2020-03-24T12:47:43Z,He also doesn&#39;t tell you South Korea is only 600 miles long by 120 miles from coast to coast whereas the U.S. is about 3000 miles wide to 1500 miles. So they can control it better.
2020-03-24T19:00:26Z,That’s true but 99% people on street wearing mask in Korea that’s amazing(but it makes me feel watching scary movie)
2020-03-24T19:05:21Z,@@user-ro2vd8tr8h I also believe it&#39;s cultural where as in the U.S. it&#39;s not. In some place it&#39;s illegal to cover your face.
2020-03-24T20:35:01Z,"Oh... why it’s illegal? Koreans are already practiced about wear mask because of China micro dust. So we can control it better . But I’m worrying(?) because our government don’t much care who came from foreign country,,"

But America, facing the surge mass of the infected, should find many more creative ways to solve the problem. The solution can be found out from the loosely coupled network and sharing economy, I guess."
2020-03-24T12:47:07Z,"For everyday use, Koreans found N95 is too difficult to breath n unnecessary.  Korea has govt certification programs for masks n KF80 masks provide sufficient protection for everyday use n KF94 is required for medical pros. KF94=N95 masks, KF80= 30% less filter than KF94."

2020-03-24T14:01:27Z,Cafelogis - I always knew the media wasn’t honest about masks not being necessary. Common sense that wearing a mask will definitely help on prevention of getting any virus.
2020-03-24T14:40:59Z,"They also have testing centers throughout the country- even drive-thru and walk-up testing sites where testing is free.  Here in the US, sick people are pleading for tests and getting turned away.  That&#39;s if they can even find a site that provides testing.  And if they&#39;re &quot;lucky&quot; enough to get tested, they have to pay hundreds of dollars.  The US has a broken healthcare system and is quickly turning into a 3rd-world country."

If you use a dry mop pad inside the mask, it may protect you from the virus. (the function of static electricity)<br>If you buy N95 masks, doctors and nurses won&#39;t get them."
2020-03-24T20:24:36Z,WE cant unlike Asian country’s we haven’t been stockpiling masks so there’s not enough to go around. Every mask a normal person buys is a mask not going to a medical professional. We can’t survive if we start losing our nurses and doctors.

2020-03-24T22:33:06Z,Never said you were hoarding masks. Just that whenever someone who buys a mask is a mask not getting in the hands of a medical professional who treats sick people. We cant survive if all our fucking nurses and doctors are sick. Don’t buy masks until the government stops talking about making more and start making more. And South Koreans had them stockpiled long before the virus. Maybe you should pay attention and think before absorbing random info.
2020-03-24T22:40:10Z,"Fallen Sully Uhhh, &amp; who told u I didnt know SK had them piled? Its their way of life.  Something us Americans should’ve learned yrs ago from the anthrax scare and other resp viruses after that; something the CDC has been informing us for yrs now.  And dont get me wrong, masks should go to our health care providers, but the lack of all these basic &amp; medical supplies falls on the hands of our gvt which its main focus has been the damn economy. I hope it crumbles."
2020-03-24T22:49:40Z,@IamVee-Basically yeah we never bothered stockpiling them. We had enough to give a steady supply for doctors and some for personnel use but never enough to spread around. Unlike Asia who wear them out often due to air pollution whether or not there’s a pandemic. And right now doctors are running out most of them are running around in fucking scarves so yeah stop going around telling people to buy masks until this is solved it’s creating more problems.

IT IS already wide spread and the governments can&#39;t even track down how many actual cases there are out there.

2020-03-24T12:30:33Z,We don&#39;t know. We don&#39;t do enough testing and tracing to understand who is spreading it right now. It might be asymptomatic carriers. It might be people who are supposed to self-isolate but go to the gym. It might be hospital staff. It might be spring breakers. It might be public transport. It might be mail deliveries. We don&#39;t know. We don&#39;t have the data. We don&#39;t know which screw to turn.

2020-03-24T20:12:21Z,We need more a lot more masks but the problem is we just don’t have enough. Trump says we are making more but all evidence suggests otherwise. Right now every person who buys a mask is one not getting in the hands of a medical professional. Don’t buy masks until this is no longer the case.
2020-03-25T22:28:31Z,Even if we do have masks people just dont wear it here. I remember I had my respirator on while doing groceries and this old lady was staring at me with her eyes open wide like I was some kind of criminal.

2020-03-24T12:15:00Z,The purpose of wearing mask is not only protecting own body but especially also protecting for somebody who don&#39;t know each other not to get infected. I really do not want somebody to get infected from me. Help each other.
2020-03-24T13:07:28Z,The only reason doctors in USA said masks dont work is because they want the masks to themselves.
2020-03-24T13:11:21Z,The medical mask does not protect you.... They protect the patiant from the doctor or nurse when they sneezes or cough during checkup or surgery...
2020-03-24T13:19:30Z,"@Dori Tos It is a lie. Think about it... if masks are useless, why doctors and medical personnel are wearing masks?"

2020-03-24T12:12:14Z,Common sense. Masks work. Why have medical workers done so and do? Wear a mask. (After replies.....do homework and make your choice. Remember N95 Respirator is what my research tells me. I care about myself and OTHERS).  Young healthy people can work to make masks....our grandparents had a pioneering spirit....start manufacturing quickly with govt. help...put $ in right place...and make masks etc that we need.  &#39;Don&#39;t give a man a fish.. teach him to fish.&#39; Then he will never again be without a fish (mask).
2020-03-24T12:43:27Z,"Barbara Bendera Not really... maybe those highly specialized ones used by health professionals but the basic masks do not work. That is why they say masks should not be worn by the regular and healthy people. People just need the mask for psychological security. The masks should be used to health care professionals, people who are sick or caring for sick people."
2020-03-24T12:49:30Z,"@barbara Bendera, you are wrong. Read again the facts."

2020-03-24T16:08:33Z,Lets nuke the bastards(the virus)!
2020-03-24T12:09:48Z,basically，south Korea uses huge number of testing. their population is small makes testing effective. and they acted quickly that makes they don&#39;t need massive lockdown. China has huge population，they uses mass number of testing and strict lockdown. unfortunately，the US doesn&#39;t have either of the measure.

2020-03-24T12:18:07Z,light yea a random guy on reddit snapped at me and they claimed “mask does not protect you” just because I told them to wear masks. So I was like welp tried to warn ya. Ain’t your dad
2020-03-24T12:23:35Z,"right, masks could not offer 100% protection against the virus, but they could slow down mutual infection"
2020-03-24T12:27:59Z,"But on a regular basis this is something they do due to the pollution... it was easier for them to this. Plus,  they have a smaller population and they take responsibility for their actions unlike our President"
2020-03-24T12:29:44Z,"It doesn’t matter what we need. WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH. What about this don’t you understand? Everyone that can produce masks, is producing them as fast as they can. So no, we won’t quit telling people they don’t need masks. Because the people that are sick, and the people caring for the sick, are the ones that need the few masks that are available. Not YOU"
2020-03-24T12:30:41Z,"Circumflêx ÂÂÂ masks can protect you. Doesn’t mean they will. Why? Because the virus enters the eyes. Masks protect the healthy from the sick, by the SICK wearing masks."

You think it&#39;s gonna be fine as long as even sick people go back to work ? The death rate is 10% , think about  how many people were infected 4 days ago? probably 4000-5000, there are almost 600 deaths, you don&#39;t die immediately when get tested positive , you die a few days later.
