2020-07-03T18:23:34Z,"Staying indoors, closing businesses, shutting down the country and threatening people who dared not to wear a mask was WRONG on every level.  There are millions of viruses in the world and they continually mutate.  NOTHING is going to 100% protect people from potential illness from viruses.  You cannot totally &quot;prevent&quot; flu or cold viruses and the same is true of Covid-19.   The precautions for FLU, colds and any other virus, is exactly the same for Covid-19.  The groups of people that could die from the Flu or even a cold, are the same groups at risk with Covid-19.  These are people who are: elderly, have compromised immune systems from disease, chemo etc., have co-morbidities such as COPD, Heart Disease, Cancer etc.  These groups are very susceptible to ANY virus and should wear appropriate masks, practice diligent hygiene, use sanitizer and practice social distancing.  99% of anyone that gets infected will survive.  Instead of telling people the truth about Covid-19, the media and corrupt politicians created hysteria and used it to do political damage against Pres. Trump.  It ALL should be a CHOICE.  If people want to wear masks, go for it, but don&#39;t mandate that EVERYONE wear them.  If you believe a mask protects you, then WHY do you care if I choose NOT to wear a mask?  After all, you believe masks protect you, right?  it is all bull sh*t and woefully misinformed people drank the Kool Aid."
2020-07-03T18:47:29Z,"Because wearing a mask protects OTHER people. Keeping your distance protects the lives of those who are at risk. And because there are other long term effects besides death, that are absolutely no fun. This isn&#39;t about donald F. trump. He is just using it to divide the country. It&#39;s not that difficult to be considerate of other people."

2020-07-03T18:21:10Z,"The tests are a sham. Even the CDC website states that they do not prove CV is the cause of infection and that the positive results may mean positive antibodies for the common cold. The official CDC numbers are now down to 47k CV deaths and that category includes pneumonia. They finally removed influenza from the data and it dropped in half. And either way, nowhere near the 150k the lamestream propaganda media keeps reporting. 50k Americans die of pneumonia every year btw. Which percentage of the 47k is actually pneumonia? Ask the CDC! Maybe they&#39;ll tell you. <br><br>You should be ashamed of yourselves, along with the rest of mainstream media. Propaganda and fear mongering, not actual data and science, is all you are &quot;reporting.&quot; Lies. And people believe and trust you. You bear part of the responsibility for the long term damage to society. The loss of lives from the propaganda and shutdown are far greater than any from CV which is a common cold that 99.74 percent of the population recovers fully from. And chloroquine has a nearly 100 percent success rate for a 5 day, inexpensive protocol that many Drs are using, including for the elderly. Masks do not work period and are a health detriment.

They chip women in their arm with little tiny birth control devices and encouraged me to do it ...very strongly encouraged me 28 years ago and I had it taken out. One day at a times ok? I sound like an AA sponser but maybe it won&#39;t be that bad. We are encouraged to get a flu shot which is a vaccine and I refuse. If the prisons get overwhelmed... chipping may be an alternative too. Try to not be negative.... Vaccines should start out voluntarily and stay that way for a while. Children are my biggest concern, will they make our children get vaccinated and what will it do to them in the long run. How many polio and smallpox vaccines failed before we have this one...I agree there are a lot of issues in the air but it isn&#39;t going to happen very quickly. Stay safe and happy 4th"

2020-07-03T18:26:47Z,"wow, that sounds pretty crazy. How many people have died from it in the past two days?"
2020-07-03T16:39:52Z,You mean to tell me that looting and rioting did not cure the virus what the fuc
2020-07-03T16:39:36Z,"I wish someone would investigate ‚ÄúHeart and Family health institute‚Äù, I know they are forcing nurses and front desk clerks to continue working even though they have tested positive for COVID-19."
2020-07-03T16:36:42Z,Where&#39;s all the clowns that insist on this being a scamdemic or plandemic or believing it&#39;s all fake and the government is just telling us to wear mask to make them comply. Did they all finally realize they&#39;re fucking morons? lol
2020-07-03T16:35:46Z,It starts at the top. Zero leadership from the Trump. Zero.

2020-07-03T16:34:34Z,"You ever notice how they actually do the tests being positive? They set it up to be if you&#39;re under 6ft of a person with Covid (that you know) you will be seen positive and told to self quarantine. The death has lowered, the masks that aren&#39;t N95 masks actually state it doesn&#39;t prevent or lower risk of COVID19. Also in stores and restaurants like Publix, Olive Garden, ext. people are actually passing out because of the lack of oxygen intake because the masks deeply lower the oxygen intake and also weaken your immune system (making many employees get COVID19). So masks aren&#39;t helping they&#39;re making it worse, hospitals aren&#39;t filled with COVID patients their filled due to stage 2 on opening hospitals for plastic surgery and other things people have held off for months, and to finish it off the news is trying to make COVID seem worse than it is, more people die from the Flu (COVID is basically a strand of the flu, tested by professional doctors) while you didn&#39;t see us flipping out over Ebola or Zika that actually could kill you by the virus itself unlike Covid where everyone is counted dead even if it was cancer or pneumonia. Social distancing actually weakens our immune systems as well, the infection rate was so low at the start due to strong immune systems unlike now where they&#39;ve weaken from being indoors so long and being away from people."
2020-07-03T16:34:33Z,Trump and his supporters truly get dumber by the day.

Folks, the confirmed antibody test is for people that have already been exposed and may not have ever known they had corona virus..immune system produced an antigen to a strain of the virus!  These are NOT NEW CASES!  Research beyond the MSM."
2020-07-03T16:29:14Z,"So now 120,000 deaths, we never hit the 2 million you were crying about, and if only you guys warned people about those darn &quot;peaceful protests&quot; leftist media has blood on theirs hands lots of it."

Naw, really? Go to a Trump rally, and everyone has to wear a mask lest their be spreading of the virus everywhere. Protest about George Floyd, and everyone can hold hands, sing a song and avoid social distancing. The hospitals being overcrowded is nonsense. The virus is as deadly as the Flu, if not less so. It&#39;s a narrative people."

Obviously we&#39;re not going to be having lots of deaths yet from the second wave, it started like a week ago.

2020-07-03T16:15:12Z,27 % of the ICU in Houston are coronavirus patients. How many people in that pool party contracted coronavirus - since chlorine makes the virus inactive.  No one said children wouldn&#39;t be affected only that it&#39;s usually not severe. 160 children died of the flu last year.  70% of the population has to be exposed to rhe virus to protect the sick and elderly.   Those who die are dying from secondary bacterial infection that invade the lungs after they are damaged by rhe virus. BACTERIAL! Meaning antibiotics will cure them! This happened already in 1918 when we didn&#39;t have antibiotics that&#39;s why it hasn&#39;t happened since. But doctors are worried about antibiotic resistance but that&#39;s for the drug companies to handle they just need to do their damn job.

The U.S is a consumer based society, if we all stay home and just have the Fed print money to try and keep the system going, we will have more then COVID to worry about, because the U.S. will collapse.  This whole  COVID thing just shows the complete incompetence of or leaders to make solid decisions to keep the U.S. a strong nation. People should be prepared for the U.S. losing the world reserve currency status and a complete dollar collapse, that is the box these idiots have created for all of us.

Beaches and bars, where adults (period) were allow to do whatever they darn well pleased. The establishments  who instead of following simple rules of limits at business amounts for drinking and staying at establishments, should have been established by owners. Now government is going to take over and close you back down. You all had the opportunity to set your own rules and ways of reopening but you didn‚Äôt.

That&#39;s because it&#39;s down to like, .3% of cases instead of their doom-n-gloom prediction of 3%, pretty hard to reach that 2.2 million goal they want to reach to justify the unconstitutional actions they forced on us to prove they&#39;re still in control.<br>These scum are all about panic and fear mongering, if it doesn&#39;t look &#39;bad&#39; or &#39;worse&#39; then they don&#39;t want you to know about it. The fact of the matter is, &#39;this &#39;still&#39; isn&#39;t as deadly as the &#39;flu&#39; is, they were busted fluffing the numbers by attributing covid to cases that died of other causes, and the vast majority of people don&#39;t even suffer from contracting it, then build antibodies that make your body able to fight it on it&#39;s own."

One where literally every country has their chief scientist on top of it and even Donald Trump is now advocating wearing a mask and talking of doing so himself. He is the one who hand-picked dr.

Ive said it many times. there are only 2 paths to take. 100 percent lock down martial law go to jail penalty, all business close, government workers stay home, cops stay home, riots go crazy no cops to arrest, gang violence surges or we can let the damned Covid have its way flow till everyone gets it."
2020-07-03T14:58:36Z,"They are looking to confuse and demoralise the population. To create fear, panic and a general sense of desperation. Then they can come in with drastic measures, a new order, a new leader and the people will accept it. This is the end times Beast System we are repeatedly warned about in scripture. When they say peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes. It&#39;s going to get worse but try not to be afraid, just trust in The Lord. Lean on Him in prayer and scripture, in praise and fasting. Everything is in hand. Repent and believe in Jesus- the time is at hand. God bless you all."
2020-07-03T20:51:43Z,"Exactly!! There is an agenda behind this whole Covid plandemic, and it is to keep us in fear of being exposed and to keep us under their control. This is actually an initiation ritual into their new order, and the wearing of masks, social distancing (6 feet?!) hand washing and lockdown, are all elements of this ritual. To condition us to their new world order and their new leader, as you said, and the sheeple are following along just like they want us to. I have God on my side, and I rely on Him to keep me safe during this time."

These are both symptomatic AND active. Which means they are less than 14 days old... I&#39;ve lost a brother, nearly lost a sister and 4 other extended family members succumbed to serious illness that they did finally recover from. I&#39;m telling you, stop denying. Stop spreading BS about ventilators killing people. Stop going anywhere where you will be clustered with others, mask or no mask. Masks will not save you but may save the people around you... For a while. Eventually, it&#39;ll come down to whether or not you can avoid exposure until we have a vaccine or remedy. Until then, nobody knows who will live and who will die and in the absence of an antibody test, there is no way to know if you&#39;ve already passed through. Keep your friends and family in mind. Do the hard things for yourselves and America and stop whining about how much you miss going out. We all do. Difference is I&#39;m willing to sacrifice to save you. Please reciprocate."

2020-07-03T15:39:29Z,"Because it didn&#39;t, data shows being outside in the sun and breeze limits infection. People going to bars and social gatherings inside buildings caused it. Honestly it&#39;s no wonder people hotboxing a virus in a room turned out worse than fresh air."

2020-07-03T14:09:27Z,If new cases going up- then why number of deaths plummeting? Its easy .. the more testing you do - the more cases you will find.... all this means is the virus is not as deadly as they have been saying.. If all this testing had been done back in March - would have gotten just as many positive results.. --- EVERYONE has been exposed - most everyone had it or has it.. But ALMOST ALL US dont get sick from it.. If more testing means higher numbers BUT the death totals keep dropping .. this is proof of what we are saying is true..

2020-07-03T14:08:18Z,I have had the Covid  19.  . But when you get tested it is positive for any strain of flu. So 50k positive of any flu virus with  a Covid strain.
2020-07-03T14:07:53Z,I think everyone that does not take this pandemic seriously should sign a waiver that they cannot go to the hospital for care when they get sick.
2020-07-03T14:48:22Z,Fine by me. You live your life on fear the death rate is less than 1% this is literally a flu and if you knew anything at all you would know that coronavirus is the medical term for the family of flu viruses!!! God damn people are so fucking gullible. They are totally lying about the numbers and Inflating deaths.

Both of them survived but said it was by far the worst virus they have ever had. One is still dealing with the side effects. Both under 50 yrs old. Im 59 and smoked cigs when I was young. Staying in and away from crowds. Taking this serious given my age and lack of a heathy life style when I was young. I think people are crazy today. At least when it comes to this virus. If you don&#39;t care about yourself that&#39;s you&#39;re right. But getting others sick and or even dead is not your right. Do they even care? How can you not care about others. It seems criminal.

But to those who have or will believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, repent from their sins and be baptized in his name for the remission of sins, I‚Äôm here as a Child of God and a lowly servent to teach you the truth of God‚Äôs word and the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ versus what the devil has taught you in the religious denominations. <br><br>The almighty God is one Lord and there are no persons in the Godhead other than God, the Father. He begat a Son (A human male child) and called him by his own name, Jesus Christ. The man Christ Jesus is one with his Father, the almighty God who is a Spirit, for all the fullness of the Godhead (God) dwells in him bodily (Colossians 2:9). Jesus Christ gave himself a ransom all, for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and the wages of our sins is death. This means to spend an eternity in hell and eventually in the lake of fire rather than eternal life in the kingdom of God. But God has given us eternal life and this life is in his Son, Jesus Christ. If you will believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and obey the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, you will receive remission of your sins by the blood of Jesus which was shed for us. There is no other way to receive remission of sins and to receive the power of God to live as a saint (Christian) rather than a sinner. The gospel is to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost (Acts <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_R0L6_RhjE&amp;t=2m38s"">2:38</a>). <br><br>Receive this free gift of salvation today because once you stand before the judgement throne, condemned, there will be no hope for you. If you truly love God and revere him, you will believe his word. To all those who want to take verses out of context and imagine it teaches contrary to the truth presented to you such as, Romans 10:9-10, Ephesians 2:8-9, and John <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_R0L6_RhjE&amp;t=3m16s"">3:16</a> you will have no audience with me. If you have a question regarding the word of God, I‚Äôm here at your service  as a child of the Living God (Christian). May the Lord bless those who will hearüëÇ his word."

2020-07-03T23:12:59Z,"Hi, I&#39;m an epidemiologist and I&#39;d like to weigh in a little. I think it&#39;s easy to make testing a political issue, but it&#39;s more important to gather accurate data about the sources, rate of transfer, proportion of non-symptomatic carriers, and to be scientific in the analysis of these data. That&#39;s how we learn how diseases work, and ultimately how to effectively treat them. The broader testing of a larger population will only give us greater data sets to work with and more accurate information, which will ultimately create better solutions to the problem. Thanks."
2020-07-03T23:56:27Z,"@@AdamAdam-zu4vp There is no way to determine rate of transfer if the tests aren&#39;t accurate. It  is  an  effort in  stupidity, and you should know this. Testing and contact  tracing are flawed at best."

Are you referring to IgG, IgM &amp; IgG, or total antibody testing? <br>Testing is really valuable in the long-term because we can better understand the formation of antibodies in exposed persons, whether it contributes to later immunity (still not ascertained), effectiveness of proposed treatments, etc. Please let me know where you completed your doctorate in immunology. Thanks!"
2020-07-04T19:17:19Z,"@@AdamAdam-zu4vp Testing has limitations? No,  the testing isn&#39;t testing for a Wuhan strain virus at all. They are testing  for  your  average coronavirus, and  finding lots of it. Apparently this flu is  weak."

This means the possibility of inflating the case count is magnified up to 15X.  These news outlets (Operation Mockingbird) will never tell you  the reason a virus that can&#39;t survive in hot temperatures like coronvirus, suddenly spiked in the middle of the summer.

I don&#39;t really know how to respond to that.  Just going about my day doing whatever the farmer and sheep dog wants me to do.  Maybe.  I like to think i would take it because I have faith in what they are doing.  When i get sick (or get an infection) and I need antibiotics... I ask question but I don&#39;t question the end game.  I know they are smarter than me.  I know they are.   If i really wanted to question it i would go to school and study to be what they are and do it myself... that way i know for sure what is going on.  But i dont have the drive, ambition, or smarts to do that.... so i trust the people that are in those positions.  Are they perfect?  Probably not.  Are they going to steer me wrong?  I like to think not.  I know, especially medically, that i have to count on others (like doctors and such).  So i am not going to be paranoid about a vaccine.

2020-07-03T16:14:30Z,"stay outside and social distance, wear a mask if youre scared beyond that. Outside events are typically exempt from limits like that, especially on Independence day. Wear your mask if you care, and encourage others to social distance at a minimum. But cmon, it&#39;s outside fresh air. And people mostly only stay close to loved one they quarantine with already. Or same for friends who have been hanging those same friends for months already. We just have to social  distance, perhaps wear masks. Be safe, hope it&#39;s good 4th of July. Don&#39;t get pissed, we have to have fireworks. Just try to encourage safety because it&#39;s happening whether we agree with it or not, people are gonna make it happen and if you try to shut it down they will just do something even stupider in response.

You have to test negative twice to be able to cleared off of having Covid. If you have the antibodies even if you‚Äôre not currently sick you are labeled as a case. And no, I live in Florida and have seen ‚Äúspikes‚Äù in cases only when they rose the amount of testing. The CDC has already said that approximately 25 million people have already been infected by the virus, that means that with the death rate supposedly at 500,000 people worldwide the death rate is .5%.

2020-07-03T13:34:43Z,"Just TESTS are reported, not cases. All the media and government are lying. With only ten per cent tested, how many have actually died. You are just as dead without being tested. If 80% of Americans get Covid-19, about 260 million, and 4.5% die which will happen when medical care is not available, that&#39;s about 11 million dead Americans. Covid-19 is not the flu. Covid-19 is something completely new. The only country to drop out of the Paris Accord and completely deny climate change is now going to completely deny Covid-19. No one knows if herd immunity is possible with Covid-19. And antibodies to Covid-19 are only lasting 1-2 months, so trump&#39;s claim he will soon have a vaccine is hollow. He won&#39;t, and if by some miracle a vaccine was produced that caused antibodies to Covid-19 to be produced, they have a lifespan of 1-2 months."

The number of people suffering from unemployment,¬†psychological problems, suicides, delayed treatment, and domestic violence has skyrocketed. Several experts believe that these¬†may claim more lives¬†than the virus itself. According to the UN,¬†millions of peoplearound the world may fall into absolute poverty and famine, which causes more disease / death.

2020-07-03T13:03:50Z,"&quot;If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic, and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extentsion, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.&quot; -Joseph Goebbels"

2020-07-03T16:43:04Z,"Once you understand exponential growth and more testing, it makes more sense.  Still, I say most of the deaths are people who were near death anyway from one thing or another. Let this thing wash over us, get it done. Just hope that having it will make you immune in the future."
2020-07-03T12:56:23Z,Why don&#39;t they talk about the fact that the mortality rates continue to decline?
2020-07-03T12:56:06Z,A surge of covid patients in the same area as all the protests... to bad the news didn&#39;t say it so it must mean protests are fine. Its bars and restaurants that are doing it. Gtfo. You&#39;re horrible MSM.
2020-07-03T12:55:32Z,"My prediction is that in a couple of weeks, there will be far more recoveries than deaths.

2020-07-03T12:55:17Z,Im in Washington state i know nurses and they have no covid patients in the hospital. Lots of pos test results but maybe thats because the tests are as b.s. as the virus

2020-07-03T12:54:01Z,Spike had nothing to do with riots only people at beaches/restaurants with families. More BS
2020-07-03T13:08:35Z,"Really now? It&#39;s harder to distance each other at large beaches and with restaurant tables between each other than having thousands of people squished together, mostly without masks (but still easy to spread regardless, the masks aren&#39;t that effective) rioting and already showing flagrant disregard for the law? You&#39;re gonna have to explain that one to me."

2020-07-03T12:52:06Z,"Why don‚Äôt you put the good news in your headlines? Or do you just thrive on scaring people? How about Covid deaths are down. You guys are hyping this way out of proportion. Most people catching this are between like 17 and 30 and almost 0 chance of being seriously ill. These masks are a false security with most ineffective.

2020-07-03T12:51:11Z,How many of those idiots that were rioting and looting last month are taking up space in the hospitals or worried about getting the virus this time around ... Those that participated shouldn&#39;t be given a bed at the hospitals - they weren&#39;t concerned when they were playing Looters and Germs ... They can sit at home and nurse themselves while watching those big screen tvs they stole while &quot; Protesting &quot;
2020-07-03T12:50:17Z,"why dont you mention that those requiring hospital stays and deaths are dropping rapidly while those with antibodies is skyrocketing? Why do you push the fear??? OH YEAH BECAUSE YOU ARE SELLOUT FEAR PORN PUSHING HACKS!!! Your manipulation of the public is showing. You guys are hacks, not journalists!!"
2020-07-03T12:50:04Z,"Cause of death has taken on a whole new meaning in this country due to the fraud called Covid-19, as no proof whatsoever is necessary to claim death occurred due to Covid-19. In addition, most any that have had a flu shot in the past ten years would most likely test positive to the PCR test; a test that does not isolate Covid-19, but it does vastly increase the numbers that can be falsely used by those with a political agenda."
2020-07-03T12:49:47Z,Now I&#39;m happy living in Massachusetts while we get to watch the rest of the country burn

2020-07-03T12:49:20Z,This wasn‚Äôt the plan the whole time? You actually want as many people as possible to get covid at the individual level to lower your odds

2020-07-03T13:16:14Z,Phlegethon each hospital that gets a patient now considers them as a COVID patient! They get extra money from the government!!! This is all fake news! They just want people to go to hospitals so they can make money!!!

2020-07-03T12:36:24Z,Just a reminder that a new case of a viral infection is NOT a death. The Anti-Trump News Media is making its full court press effort to slam dunk Joltless Joe Biden&#39;s braindead head down the seemingly gullible throats of the American Public. Death and disease are not new News;  neither is life  meant to be lived in a bubble.
2020-07-03T12:36:11Z,These are Fake numbers for sure. False positives and pampered media numbers account more than 3/4 of what is being called ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù cases. The media only cares about one thing....views and viewers.

2020-07-03T12:35:42Z,"Please take the red pill, folks. The media and government officials are apparently fighting their fight to continue to spread misinformation and lies to the public. It‚Äôs all scare tactics as usual.  Where are the facts supported by data behind their claims of existential danger? Do not accept sound bites as truth. Notice the media and WHO only focus on infections but never on the % of recoveries which is over 93%. Infection to fatality is a minuscule 0.31% and exposure to fatality is a mere 0.10%.  These numbers are in line with a common flu. The masks actually make you sick from lack of proper oxygen and inhalation of carbon dioxide (yours).  Moreover, the entire push for masks, contact tracing, social distancing (dividing families and relationships) and closure of the economy v√≠a lockdowns is certainly not justifiable given the true facts.  Hence, you should ask yourself who benefits from pushing this extreme agenda/propaganda of fear which is evident by the fact that we are constantly bombarded with news of existential threat 24x7.  Understanding the facts requires effort via research whereas simply accepting what is being told by the media is plain laziness. Up to you, but I don‚Äôt recommend living in fear simply because it‚Äôs too much effort to research the facts behind this virus and confirm the story lines told by the media.  Be inquisitive and search the truth. Here are a few links with facts for your reference:<br>1) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BUBTtUTOII"">https://youtu.be/3BUBTtUTOII</a><br>2) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTDe8YsQDu8"">https://youtu.be/fTDe8YsQDu8</a><br>3) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuOxG-rnj30"">https://youtu.be/wuOxG-rnj30</a><br>4) https://youtu.be/UDoP-Sgimvg<br>5) <a href=""https://medium.com/analyticaper/covid-19-what-the-data-tells-us-3a08e42ee36f"">https://medium.com/analyticaper/covid-19-what-the-data-tells-us-3a08e42ee36f</a><br>6) <a href=""https://medium.com/analyticaper/covid-19-what-the-data-tells-us-in-detail-3640748bd049"">https://medium.com/analyticaper/covid-19-what-the-data-tells-us-in-detail-3640748bd049</a>"
2020-07-03T15:32:31Z,"People were saying this same thing when the last spike hit and then the deaths came. The death rate is from people who caught the disease weeks ago. It takes 2 weeks to a month for a person to die so the number of deaths will always trail the current infections. Don&#39;t compare a delayed death rate to the current infection rate, it will make people take this less seriously."
2020-07-04T02:53:38Z,"@ZAYA G, thank you for your reply. Did you take the time to see the links I provided? In one of those there is a good explanation of the deaths trends you are pointing out. Trust that I don‚Äôt take this lightly and thus when I make a statement I first ensure I have the facts behind it. I have spent hundreds of hours in research over the past 5 months so I know what I am talking about and my only intent is to help other see the truth to help them reduce their unjustified fears. If you still believe you are correct, please share the facts behind your claims so others can learn. Otherwise, spreading misinformation and fear is immoral to society which is what the national media, government and their agencies have been doing.

2020-07-03T12:30:12Z,That&#39;s partly because hospitals are a little more prepared and people at risk are more likely to wear masks or avoid public. I&#39;m in Alabama where people claimed it was all fake and I&#39;m even seeing old folks taking precautions.<br><br>There&#39;s also a weird thing about number suppression. A lot of deaths occur at home and go without testing. Some areas like NYC had to stop testing those numbers during the height of issues and places like Florida may not be testing them at all (which a nurse friend has mentioned she&#39;s suspected a few times)

Look at what happened in New York. Florida has a large number of seniors, who tend to be republicans, when the seniors in ‚Äúover 55 ‚Äúcommunities ,assisted living, and nursing homes become covid patients the republicans will have killed their own supporters. 43 percent of covid deaths in the USA occurred in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The overall death rate for those over 65 is even higher. Trump has conned his supporters, brought out the worse in many and now is killing them needlessly. Please look at Texas, Florida, and Arizona again. There hasn‚Äôt been enough time to evaluate the impact of covid from the demonstrations which happened outdoors.

2020-07-03T12:10:10Z,Anthony F could it be because of your great leadership and direction in managing this crisis.  Complete failure of the federal government and its leadership in this covid outbreak.  <br>Could it be that Anthony you are trying to profit from this outbreak?  Our leaders have completely failed our Country in this pandemic. They are to busy arguing and lying to actually work on leadership of the people. Our Country deserved better than the joke on both sides of the isle.<br>Good luck everyone!

2020-07-03T12:04:50Z,"We closed everything down so that hospitals were not overrun. Not to stop the disease! This is what‚Äôs supposed to happen. Cases go up and herd immunity builds. Let‚Äôs look at the positive side. Deaths are not surging (probably because the mayors of NY and NJ already killed most of their elderly population but I digress). Protect your sick and elderly. Wash your hands, wear a mask, clean your homes and businesses, Social distance as much as you can and let‚Äôs get back to work. Stop giving into all this fear."

2020-07-03T17:10:26Z,ZAYA G We reopened here in NYC almost a month ago and our death rate continues to be very low. We have a population of almost ten million so I expected us to have the highest rates. I just don‚Äôt think we can stop this thing. We need to move forward taking precautions and hoping for the best.
2020-07-03T12:04:48Z,"Remember, as long as you support BLM, you arent spreading the virus."

2020-07-03T13:27:29Z,Because there is an agenda being pushed. People that have antibodies are being counted as infected and if you do some more digging you‚Äôll see that hospitals inflate numbers for a lot of reasons. Also it‚Äôs a great distraction ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2020-07-03T13:27:37Z,"Are you dumb? Do you understand the implication of what you&#39;re saying? Let&#39;s say no one worries and the virus spreads so that the number of people simultaneously suffering symptoms increases, do you really think the 1% death rate would remain unchanged? Even if it did stay the same, 1% of the US population is over 3 million people. If you&#39;re okay with them dying then ... I don&#39;t even know what to say."

2020-07-03T11:59:41Z,We are a country run by demougouges and this is the fallout from it. If we dont stop arguing with each other and start getting rid if people in our government (regardless of party) we&#39;re screwed.
2020-07-03T11:59:08Z,These idiots that hold these kinds of parties should be held accountable should anyone die because of these idiots an investigation should follow and if the death of the person can be attributed to this type of behavior they should be jailed and go to trial this is no different than someone passing Aids along intentionally A law needs to be inacted immediately
2020-07-03T11:58:59Z,Why do I feel that this is all a lie from fake news !  If everyone is asymptotic then this is all bull$hit.  Since all the doctors that fill out a death certificate are being told to make it a Wuhan virus death and not the true death cause.
2020-07-03T11:58:17Z,Percentage of deaths?
2020-07-03T11:57:55Z,They still haven&#39;t counted the MILLIONS OF SHOPPERS YET LOL. WHAT BS!

It is just speculation to say this could result in a big increase in hospitalizations and deaths. There are no sign that is happening yet.

2020-07-03T13:26:50Z,Jonathan Williams did you forget about the old white people who protested about wearing a mask? They brought guns to the capital and tore the American flag out of police hands. The police stood there. That ain‚Äôt peace.

They need to arrest those who needlessly endanger others by not following guidelines including Trump!

The President should have taken control in the beginning with one plan, one national effort.  The Democrat party would also have had to fall in line with a national plan. When the annual seasonal flu hits, this situation is going to get even worse for everyone and in addition the economy will falter even more.  There&#39;s only one viable solution that I can see but it will have risks.  The President needs to take control with a national plan and the Democrat party needs to go with it - no rebuttal.  Vastly scale up N95 masks manufacturing without a respirator and make it mandatory for wear inside stores and businesses.  Not for parks or on beaches or when just walking on streets.  (some city streets like in New York City have a lot of people so governors could decide if they are typically too crowded and would need to wear a mask)  All stores and businesses could open at full capacity or less, their choosing.  Social distancing in effect. People will make their own choices on how much they want to expose themselves.  Hospitals will do the best they can but everyone must realize that if they take chances it comes with risk.  Don&#39;t expect hospitals to save everyone.  The plan would have basic mandatory guidelines and governors would decide on the particulars.  The Democrat party would need to stop fighting Trump on whatever decision is made and fall in line on behalf of America."

A dangerous joke!<br>I guess we&#39;re supposed to be too confused by all the different kinds of breaking bad news to notice that Washington D.C. shoveled over five trillion dollars into Wall Street coffers, and wants to continue the work. The entire pandemic response is being conducted from the top down. The CDC has made it so anyone can have COVID-19, despite a negative test result. The COVID death rates are exaggerated. Hospitals have a financial incentive to write COVID-19 down as much as possible. The CDC made it easy for hospitals to put COVID-19 down on a death certificate even if there was no test. As of last month, the CDC added seasonal allergy, common cold, and stomach flu symptoms to the list of COVID-19 symptoms. People like Andrew Cuomo and Dr. Fauci have discredited themselves many times over. They have been changing their stories and moving the pandemic goalposts the entire time. Sadly, this is a partisan issue. It shouldn&#39;t be, but the media will try to convince everyone that it is. Many of us on the left question the quarantine and mask-wearing too."

2020-07-03T08:48:53Z,A high infection rate is good if most of those who test positive are asymptomatic. It means most people are developing an immunity. The only % increase that matters is the hospitalization rate and why are we not using hydroxychloroquine when most doctors who used reported positive results?
2020-07-03T09:16:04Z,Hyrodxychloroquine more importantly helps manage the symptoms of Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis... Why waste medication trying to save 0.001%???

Only the N95 masks approved by the CDC for medical use are at all effective at blocking the virus and they, as the name implies, block only 95% of virus particles.  Masks do not guarantee protection, therefore they should not be required in public spaces.  Anyone in a public place not wearing a mask who is arrested for that will be able to sue and win.  There is plenty of evidence of tests available online that show the masks to be ineffective.  For this reason, the CDC does not require masks, unless you want to feel &quot;more comfortable&quot;.<br>ETSY, one of the major internet sources for masks, now has on their website the warning to their sellers that &quot;You are not to claim any medical benefit for our masks&quot; , precisely because of this fact.<br>If you&#39;ve been out in public spaces, your commercially available masks have not been protecting you.  if you haven&#39;t been sick, mask or not, that means there has been no virus in the places where you&#39;ve been. <br>The question then becomes, &quot;is there virus anywhere?&quot;"

Why are the demoncratics not protecting the public but are instilling fear and allowing looting and burning and statue destruction.    But notice how quickly the politicians call the police to protect them from the friendly demonstrators.   But also note how quickly the News will turn you into the face of terrorism if you try to protect your life and property.     Now the Draconian Nuesome of california is threatening the people with fines if they catch you without a mask in public.   He can find the money to put storm troopers to find you and fine you but people loosing their livelihood and trying to ride this man made pandemic will also be given a hefty Fine thus forcing them to shut down.

There were pool parties and so many people crowding the beaches. Mother‚Äôs Day was out of control and many people were out carelessly having fun together. Then if you want to include protests, there were the huge protests of people angry about the quarantine and angry about having to wear masks. They were protesting against it all. There are so many reasons to contribute."

They started first, they made the coronavirus cases go up, trumps rally didnt cause the coronavirus to get worst, ALSO Trumps team for the rally made sure everyone followed guidelines and safety measures. The media says its trumps fault‚Äù, because they hate him. Liberal news are people who are embittered and have indignation in their heart.

After the microneedes dissolve under the skin, they leave the encapsulated quantum dots whose patterns can be read to identify the vaccine that was administered.<br><br>The quantum-dot tattoos will likely be supplemented with Bill Gates‚Äô other undertaking called¬†ID2020, which is an ambitious project by Microsoft to solve the problem of over 1 billion people who live without an officially recognized identity. ID2020 is solving this through digital identity. Currently, the most feasible way of implementing digital identity is either through smartphones or¬†RFID microchip implants.

2020-07-03T05:08:14Z,How many deaths? You won&#39;t report that though... Stop with the manipulative stats. FAKE NEWS.
2020-07-03T05:07:57Z,"Why casino&#39;s must b closed until 2021<br>By the casino workers of Blackhawk Colorado <br>Animosity- During times of great division and fear, tensions will always run high, chances of mass murder skyrocket along with the chances of discrimination and hate crimes, opening casino&#39;s invites many kinds of people from all over the country into those cities, among them may very well be the last person workers on the frontlines get to see. Inviting tourists into any city is generally ill advised during a pandemic,  but out right foolish amid the many things happening in 2020. We have seen shootings, stabbings,  hate crimes, and  possible lynchings at an increased and unknown rate, putting many minorities and foreigners in a state of fear. People on one side are in fear for their lives, often the ones working,  while others refuse to follow safety protocols.  This can lead to arguments, fights, and even murder. Just the other day a man was removed from property for threatening to cough in a workers face, this is not the first time something like that has occurred on this mountain.  Most casino workers are terrified aside from most Trump supporters, who often believe the virus is a hoax. This kind of foolishness can lead to bad things, such as mentioned before as well as risk spreading the virus to high risk people who, despite being advised to stay home go out to stay a few nights at casinos with little to no protection.  In the last two weeks I&#39;ve had more than 100 people get angry about screenings and wearing masks, often starting to refuse, joking around playing with their mask, and waiting for workers to walk away before taking their masks back down.<br><br><br>Fear- I have a saying,  fear is the root of all evil, fear brings the worst out of any living creature. This means heightened animosity, more common discrimination with more open racism, more frequent hate crimes, less tolerant  frontline workers in most industries including the police.  Fear also has a way of making anyone with a gun alot more trigger happy which is why we see intimidating looking innocents being shot to death more frequently during fearful times.  I&#39;ve had people get angry and rip off their masks and it seems to be more and more common.<br><br><br><br>Gambling/other addictions - History has shown that gambling addictions are powerful, in many cases a hardcore gambler will be willing to die for their addiction as we saw when a casino was burned down and bodies were found burned to death wile still trying to spin slot machines. There is no way to keep a covid 19 patient home with a gambling addiction and chances are they will lie on their screenings and pass with ease. A 76 year old man with stage four cancer said he has no symptoms, no shortness of breath and was let in. Gambler&#39;s are spreading covid throughout the economy and no one seems to talk about it, the only way to keep these people home, is complete closure of all casino&#39;s throughout the US. Some gamblers get into chew simply so they never leave their machines and leave spit cups and spit all over the place.<br><br><br>Passivity/irresponsibility - Not everyone is concerned with the safety of other, many are not even concerned with their own safety.  Without leadership during a pandemic it is near impossible to get everyone on tye same page. Too many are far to passive until the virus takes them or someone too close to home for their own comfort.  These past two weeks have shown that many people still treat workers on the front lines like robots, with little care and consideration for their safety and comfort.  Most casino&#39;s as expected will put money first which is exactly what we are seeing today.<br>Numerous casino workers are complaining on a daily basis while trying not to be out in the open with these complaints you rarely hear about,  often in fear of loosing their jobs.  Most common complaints: management not enforcing rules when its VIPs, casino head count limits not being enforced and the amount of people being let in not being counted, constantly dealing with issues enforcing social distancing, people removing masks to eat entire meals, people holding drinks near their mouths to keep theirs masks down and getting away with it if they play enough money, Rich people doing whatever they want and getting away with things like turning the safety protocols into a joke, coworkers testing positive and being sent on sick leaves being covered up along with many health hazards in the workplace. That was just a small list of the many complaints we hear from casino workers all over the US.<br>Upon opening, casino&#39;s offered workers their jobs back resulting in a loss of benefits all over the country, while still taking away health benefits they once had, I, myself am high risk and was told id be denied benefits if i chose to stay home, while many casino towns such as mine, have zero job listings for anything other than casino&#39;s.<br><br>Flawed safety protocols - Health experts have told us a few key things.  1: Theres a good chance a mask will not protect you from the virus.  2: Not everyone with covid 19 will have a fever and have but to lie in order to pass the screening. Ive probably screened more than 1000 people including babies in the last two weeks, and not once did someone fail, they always say no to every symptom yet you often see people coughing and sniveling throughout the casino&#39;s. Social distancing is impossible on many of these properties,  and few of them are taking head counts which often leads to casino&#39;s going far over tye 175 person limit, some people have so much built up animosity that they go so far as to purposely urinate on bathroom walls and floors, I have witnessed it myself.<br><br>Many of us have been working in casino&#39;s for years, 10 years for me. We are this economy,  not only did some our benefits get taken away too early, we were forced to make a decision between risking our lives to continue lining the pockets of the rich, who are not here with us and probably staying safe at home, and turning down the job offers and loosing all income including pandemic assistance. Under no circumstances should we have been forced to choose between our lives and our livelihood. We have made more than enough money for  the rich and payed more than enough in taxes to get some of that money back while staying safe away from this virus. No one should have to work in these conditions and few  gambler&#39;s show any mercy or concern. <br><br>Blackhawk Colorado where many are tempted to throw away their livelihood in fear of their lives.<br><br>I wrote this with the help of many workers on this mountain."

The ONLY COUNTS THAT MATTER are: positive infection RATE per number of Covid-19 tests on unique people (some employers require repeat tests until the employee tests negative), number of people in ICU DUE TO COVID-19, number of people admitted to a hospital DUE TO COVID-19, and¬†the number of people who died DUE TO COVID-19. IN ADDITION, some states have experienced an increased infection rate because infected illegal immigrants are fleeing Mexico into those states.¬†Also, some tests give a false positive result. Finally, the death rate DUE TO COVID-19 is DOWN in most states and some of those deaths are FALSELY CODED AS DUE TO COVID-19."

This plandemic is redicules anyone that still believes anything they say on main stream media you need to wake up. It&#39;s the same try to scare the people, than divide, and try to make them fight amogst each other, black vs white, mask vs no mask.

Protein encapsulation is actually a natural phenomenon.Viruses utilize protein shells to protect their genetic material before releasing it into cells. . someone who has had it and donates blood actually gives the RNA sequence/ protein needed to encapsulate the virus. they figured this out with polio 70 years ago. do you need a shot every year for polio? so when they say there is no cure technically they are not lying..  they would rather inject you with small amounts of the virus(which can make you sick)  to build a natural immunity. research research research dont let the word trickery fool you.

2020-07-03T02:55:14Z,If this holds then its all over in two months as far as infections are concerned. Everyone in the US will have been infected. (50k x 60days=300milion).

You guys need to limit contact unless your a doctor and to the doctors who are working during this pandemic make sure to wash your hands often and just give yourself a pat on the back and when this pandemic is over reward yourself for doing such a great job I don&#39;t care how you do it but you deserve something. I&#39;m not sure about Texas for the most part but I know my family limits contact stays inside and wears masks outside. Please help stop this spread. I know it&#39;s hard staying inside but the longer you guys keep spreading Covid 19 the longer it&#39;s going to be before we can get back to normal. Trust me it&#39;s boring but we have phones play a game bingwatch Netflix and Hulu. Have a family game night or even movies AT HOME please I ask you to please help stop the spread of Covid 19 by staying inside and encouraging others to do so as well.
2020-07-03T06:34:45Z,Exactly. People really need to listen to the rules and regulations. Not doing so is ruining everything. People can be so damn ignorant and it‚Äôs annoying. It‚Äôs not that hard to stay inside and wear a mask when going out.

2020-07-03T02:47:57Z,Fauci is by far no expert ! This is a planned political thing ! The masks are just going to make you sick because you&#39;re cutting your oxygen intake and then your immune system will become weak ! If you are sick wear a mask to keep from blowing all over others. That&#39;s the only time a mask should even be thought of using. I&#39;m not so sure these positive results are nothing more than the standard flu that are now being counted because everyone is going to the ER or where ever and being tested that normally wouldn&#39;t have even went to a doctor just stayed home and rode it out. Something to think about !

2020-07-03T03:04:17Z,Dave oh I have taken responsibility for my sins and asked God to forgive them the only one running is you. Repent and trust Christ this world doesn&#39;t have long left at the rate of decline of morals. You will meet Christ one day on your knees either in respect or fear you rejected him for so long but Christ longs that you would turn to Him and repent of your sins. He did die for them after all.

More men aren&#39;t dying because this country is sexist, but because there are physiological and biological DIFFERENCES between the sexes that put men more at risk of serious illness than women. But that <i>can&#39;t</i> be the case for differences in infection rates and deaths between African-Americans/Latinos and whites, right? It <i>can&#39;t</i> be that minority communities are more likely to live in closer proximity to one another (in cities) than whites (in suburbs or rural areas), and that they are disproportionately affected by underlying conditions, which has been <i>scientifically proven</i> to greatly increase the risk of death from COVID-19?

2020-07-03T02:22:52Z,"Statments like yours always perplex me?  You do realize that people were out not but a few days/weeks ago rioting and protesting, right?  Mostly unprotected in tight groups, right?  Same as the trump supporters, right?  <br><br>Yet there wasn&#39;t a single condemnation about that from the general media and very little from the supposedly all knowing health care officials.  The hypocrisy of your statment speaks volums for yours, as well as other similar minded people&#39;s, intelligence.  Well, rather the lack thereof. <br><br>If you haven&#39;t noticed the shift in talking points for covid has gone from &quot;it&#39;s deadly&quot; to &quot;people are getting infected.&quot;  Those are two vastly different story prompts.  When in reality the death rate is actually decreasing. Not by a lot, but still decreasing. Yet we should still cower in fear and vote Dem to fix everything."

2020-07-03T02:46:01Z,"it‚Äôs the media double standard that people are complaining about, not even necessary the protests. They didn‚Äôt even mention concern for the virus for the 3-4 weeks the protests were going on. Then they turn around and blame it on the person sitting at the bar having a beer or the 3 people in the gym late evening. The fact is the protests did throw gas on the fire for the spread of Corona, and totally erased 3+ months of lockdowns that everyone went through."
