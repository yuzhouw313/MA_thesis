2020-04-06T17:29:20Z,"🔴Ivermectin <br><br>FDA approved in 1987. The optimal dose of ivermectin in humans is 150 µg / kg. The half-life of ivermectin in plasma is about 18 hours. Ivermectin is metabolized in the liver. Ivermectin and its metabolites were excreted in almost all feces over about 12 days, and excretion by urine was less than 1% of the dose. It has been reported that CYP3A4 is mainly involved in the metabolism of this drug. The drug has also been reported to be a substrate for human and mouse P glycoproteins. Ivermectin is highly fat-soluble, which increases absorption in fatty foods. In addition, the safety is very high, but it has a long half-life, so if you continue taking it for a long time, the blood level increases and there is a possibility of side effects. efficacy For animals in 1981 (licensed in 1987 for humans) Nematodes, tickworms and pesticides. Roundworms, nematodes, pinworms, worms, duodenum including gastrointestinal parasites, other scabies, heads, etc. When ivermectin was administered to microparasites, it decreased by 98% within 2 weeks. Maintained for 12 months (Mosquitoes die if they take blood from people who have been given one of the anthelmintics, Ivermectin.) .<br><br>How to use and take it as an anthelmintic &#39;Rotary beetle, nematode, pinworm: use 150 ~ 200 ug / kg (remember that it is microgram, very small amount) &#39;Use of 400ug / kg of Lymphatic Insufficiency &#39;Patients with spinal cord injury: Muscle spasm should be noted when administering &quot;subcutaneously&quot; less than 1.6 µg / kg twice a week for 12 weeks. <br><br>toxicity Appropriate dose per 60kg human body 12 µg and 24 µg Side effects appear at 72mg of human body weight of 60kg. Mortality of 50% when oral administration is 121mg, 2.43mg of mortality 50% when administered intraperitoneally The dose of ivermectin is not in microgram (µg) milligram easy (mg) units; ivermectin&#39;s LD50 lethal dose is 60 mg in human body weight and 120 mg. If you take this dose, 50% of people who die may die.<br><br>characteristic Ivermectin is highly fat-soluble, which increases absorption in fatty foods. It is more effective to take ivermectin after a fat-rich meal to increase blood levels. Stability is very high, but it has a long half-life, so if you continue taking it for a long period of time, your blood level will increase, which may lead to side effects. <br><br>In addition, ivermectin is a drug that kills parasites through gaba, which paralyzes gaba. Therefore, it is the best medicine for killing parasites. In mammals, GABA receptors are present only in the brain, and avermectins are selective, because they are difficult to cross the blood-brain barrier. <br><br>In mammals, the Gaba receptor is in the brain. In other words, since the blood-brain barrier (BBB) ​​of a mammalian human is blocked like a shield, a person is generally safe when taking the correct dose. However, if ivermectin is inadvertently overdone a safe dose, or if a blood-brain barrier is pierced by a combination of specific drugs, ivermectin enters into the brain Gaba receptor, which is dangerous and can lead to death. .<br>."

2020-04-06T16:56:39Z,The &quot;queen&quot; has nothing to offer. Down with the monarchy!
2020-04-06T17:12:13Z,"If we didn&#39;t have the Queen and had a president instead then any old clown could be running our country id rather the Royal family stayed, the Queen loves her country whether you like her or not. Her dad loved Britain too he did soooo much during the war..."
2020-04-06T17:15:09Z,Kings and queens are such an archaic way to run a country. I&#39;d be deeply ashamed to be ruled over by them. POTUS Mr. Trump is an elected official and has earned his respect. An incredibly successful businessman who knows all the tricks of the trade. G-dbless Mr. Trump and his family.
2020-04-06T17:34:07Z,"@@tt5520 we don&#39;t have a choice here in Britain I don&#39;t really listen to the Queen, i am scottish and I am listening to our first minister nicola sturgeon she&#39;s as close as Donald trump as we are going to get. I love trump BTW"
