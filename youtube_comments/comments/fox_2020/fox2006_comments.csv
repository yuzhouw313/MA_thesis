2020-11-18T05:17:46Z,"450,000 Americans died in ALL the wars fought in the 20th century.  More than 450,000 Americans will die from COVID.  It ain&#39;t just a flu."
2020-11-09T16:17:28Z,"The Republicans are just trying to shore up Social Security by knocking off as many recipients as possible using coronavirus. This is part of their long term policy of same by making it hard as possible to get health care. This is standard Republican policy of trying to keep things solvent no matter the cost. You can see this in looking at the statistical data on life expectancy. They can&#39;t tell their base this because they would have to admit Darwin&#39;s survival of the fittest, which would conflict with the Biblical story. However it is purely statistical  and science based so they are secretly proud of their efforts and the success of their methods."
2020-11-03T06:56:46Z,The people. Once the information was made public we should have done our part. Instead people deliberately ignore the solution
2020-10-09T22:28:02Z,Who is supposed to protect Americans if only there was a job where you where supposed to protect and serve the county ü§î a leader of the free world we can count on?

2020-09-23T02:01:32Z,"The Murdoch family is murdering Americans.  Why is this acceptable to Americans?  The answer is simply, his news (sic) organizations are more concerned serving as Trump‚Äôs personal propaganda machine.  We have to stop this now.   Boycott advertisers on Fox News and all products from Australia.  Divest all holdings of News Corp."

2020-08-23T21:31:24Z,Trump needs to stop calling names and start acting like a grownup and lead. Stop acting like a baby!! Pilots among others are getting laid off and the Republicans are taking vacation instead of getting the heals act signed!!
2020-08-23T21:29:16Z,"Trump virus is Trump&#39;s fault. Trump did nothing to control it and he did not do anything to help the economy. If Trump was in charge of ebola instead of Obama, we would all have been dead. Trump needs to take responsibility and stop blaming everyone else. It has been our problem for many months now. He should have controlled it in the beginning."
2020-08-21T16:18:12Z,Donald Trump. Period.
2020-07-31T23:14:10Z,Trump needs more voodoo and witch drs in this covd fight

2020-07-23T16:50:30Z,"For sure Trump, the leader of the country. The person downplaying the virus from the start and refusing to wear a mask is absolutely not at fault here. At all."
2020-07-23T01:06:14Z,"I&#39;m in Canada.  Stores here are enforcing &quot;social distancing&quot; and the number of people allowed in but not the requirement to wear masks.  However, here, many Canadians are choosing to wear a masks anyway but if a store did have a requirement that you wear a mask we would adhere to that. Please America, scientists and doctors know more than your politicians."
2020-07-20T10:25:33Z,Seriously they are trying to pretend that FOX news has no idea why America has fared so poorly compared to other countries- Blame the wilful negligence of the president.
2020-07-19T19:06:20Z,"Thousands of people are unnecessarily dying because no one can get through to  trump that massive testing will LOWER the number of covid cases. IF WE KNOW WHO HAS IT WE KNOW WHO TO ISOLATE TO STOP THE SPREAD. There is a great graph on the NY curve where they superimpose the amount of testing with the number of cases, and as the testing goes up the cases go down. The problem with this virus are the asymptomatic people who are infected running around without masks at mass gatherings! I&#39;m a nurse in AZ &amp; if I hear one more positive patient say....duh...I wish NOW that I had taken this seriously...wow! As for blaming the Chinese, Trump fired the medical spies embedded in china 4 months before the pandemic...they were our eyes &amp; ears there for the sole purpose of telling us when disease was coming out of there.....its not Chinas fault he did that! China is secretive, we knew that, that why the spies were there, we didnt know about the pandemic sooner....because trump fired them...ask Dr Lina Quick...the last to go. There is no excuse for people to chose to be misinformed in a free press society. He is lying .....get off FAUX &amp; Do your research."
2020-07-19T06:17:54Z,"Just look at Fox &quot;news&quot; coverage of the virus at the beginning of the outbreak. Who&#39;s to blame? Well, you are Fox news, you are."
2020-07-18T21:19:46Z,The Minister of Health is a difficult profession today. Brazil has changed its minister 3 times for the last 3 months.
2020-07-16T17:04:59Z,"Democrats: If we keep fudging the Covid numbers, we will win through mail-in voting!<br>Patriots: Of course you need to resort to cheating, because we&#39;re sick of this sh*t."
2020-07-16T05:39:00Z,"It all Hillary fault, she did not win the Presidency."
2020-07-11T15:29:32Z,Trump and his idiotic leadership.
2020-07-09T03:34:35Z,Trump says wearing masks feel like doing it with rubbers

2020-07-05T00:44:28Z,Why is Fox news pushing Coronavirus fear?

2020-07-04T16:58:26Z,Typical Fox News instead of finding a solution you want to find someone to blame. Well now you can blame Herman Cain he&#39;s got the virus and has been at several rallies as well without a mask.

2020-07-01T11:57:44Z,"The morality rate for COVID-19 is ~5%. Assuming everyone on the planet is exposed to the virus, 400M people will die. However, the mortality rate will increase as hospitals fill up and cannot treat new patients. Trump and the GOPigs took a gamble ending lockdown and lost. Now we all have to pay the price."
2020-06-30T19:02:14Z,"Let‚Äôs apply Trump‚Äôs OWN statement of presidential responsibility - TODAY...‚ÄùLeadership: Whatever happens, you&#39;re responsible.

2020-06-30T11:48:05Z,"I&#39;ll tell you who is to blame. I live in the upstate of South Carolina and I see people walk around here like Coronavirus doesn&#39;t even exist. I drive past restaurants and bars and the parking lots are absolutely packed with cars. To keep our businesses open and prevent another lockdown, we need to at least acknowledge this thing is still out there and try to at least limit our face to face interactions.

2020-06-30T01:32:36Z,foxnews should get some of blame
2020-06-30T01:31:55Z,Trump reacted way to slow and now we real Americans have to face the consequences. He has done a terrible job handling the virus and should‚Äôve took it more seriously
2020-06-29T22:01:20Z,"keep blaming, keep dying while most other countries are back to normal already. President of this country is not leading for a cure, rather leading people like you shouting and blaming. Would you think blame will resolve the problem? No... blaming will keep the situation bad, the country closed and give opportunity to other countries to use the valuable time to beat America in every aspects."

2020-06-29T10:11:30Z,Mr. Trump is now whining about how his job is really tough. Maybe he should have put more thought into running for President before he came down that escalator with his third wife.

2020-06-29T06:49:39Z,"The Republican Party  faces a dilemma. It may be better now for it to acknowledge the struggle against coronavirus has been lost in the absence of a strategy to fight it. You can now choose to let as many people who will die from it actually do so and then finish off those who are chronically sick  but who survive by removing Obamacare and not replacing it. Then those who survive can maximize their economic opportunities and revitalize the economy.  Those who have heart, lung, immune conditions or who are just obese will therefore mostly perish and a healthy population will recharge the economy. A huge number will die but a healthier economy will emerge over time.<br>Unfortunately, annihilating the elderly will remove the Republican base, so it is undoubtedly a risky strategy."
2020-06-29T06:29:10Z,Who‚Äôs to blame? You mean to tell me that you have no clue?   Just turn on the television or listen to Democraps.
2020-06-29T05:38:37Z,"Guys please get this info out there 331,000,000 is the US Population.              2,500,000 is the amount infected.

2020-06-29T01:58:11Z,"The problem with the President is that the media has reported everything in a way that looks bad for him, not that he has done a bad job. It is sad that you don&#39;t even report that."

Not to mention the Middle east which is one big mess thanks to USA and all their interference in other nations governance. All over the World You have been manipulating elections the last 70 years. So can we all agree that MAGA is impossible... Only MAG is possible.... Since Your country never have been great... Sorry to say so... And ruining some peoples self-image. Sorry for bad grammar."
2020-06-28T09:16:40Z,People have the right to blame china on how they handled the Chinese part of combating the virus.

That is why Americans are on the brink to become illegal aliens in the EU. And Chinese people not.

2020-06-28T04:44:15Z,Easy...Republicans
2020-06-28T03:34:35Z,"It doesn&#39;t matter what that state does if people don&#39;t follow the rules you&#39;re going to see negative consequences.  Even in these shelter-in-place states those who stayed home got sick.  In one of these 27 states they could have caught it at home and the first thing they did was get together with people and not social distancing and passed it on to others. But don&#39;t get me wrong it&#39;s not always deliberate, it&#39;s very easy to forget to wash your hands after something is delivered to your place and then make the mistake of touching your face. Some people haven&#39;t trained themselves to do these things. There are lots of people who almost never washed their hands in their life. I&#39;ve seen guys in public washrooms just put water on their hands for a second. You can&#39;t expect them to wash their hands like a medical worker."
2020-06-28T03:02:52Z,Check the level of 5G being ommited. Too high levels make people have flu like symptoms . It can also cause breathing problems and even change our blood platelets
2020-06-28T02:36:20Z,The FAKE News NETWORKS.  Rioters are okay.  No  Covid for them.
2020-06-28T02:32:26Z,The deaths are down 90%. Since testing is up of course cases are going to be up... it‚Äôs the deaths that we would be concerned about... more reason we should not need the masks plus we should never Shutdown the country again...
2020-06-28T02:26:34Z,"marx and lenin compared to stonewall jackson, and lee, lenin and marx are responsible for like 300 million deaths, jackson defended his state and lee the same. wow what a comparison"

2020-06-28T00:11:04Z,"Fox News is to blame.  &#39;It&#39;s a hoax&#39; is what they told Americans, back when they had the chance to tell the truth and head the pandemic off at the pass. Instead Fox News ran with the Trump line and not the truth.  God help America, as it&#39;s going to need all the help it can get."
2020-06-28T00:10:55Z,"Who&#39;s to blame? The people who shut us down in March. If we weren&#39;t out there, we couldn&#39;t get it, get over it, and get on with our lives. Only the elderly and sick, and those who live with them, needed to stay home. I live alone, and probably had it in February. I should have stayed working. Actually, the surge is probably 90% those who had it in the winter and are just now finding out because of testing."
2020-06-28T19:06:02Z,Really? I didn&#39;t know that you can test positive 6 months later.
2020-06-28T00:08:57Z,Who‚Äôs to blame? fake lame stream media democratic run demonic media. Get out of here we are not falling for it after you allowed millions to loot for months without saying a word about the virus. You lame stream media are the virus.

2020-06-27T22:15:22Z,"I think the virus is a good thing for America.  It is a good wake up call!  Over the last 20 years the US has been riding high on the fortunes of the early grow after the second world war and many Americans have become complacent and and ignorant of the fact that we are a giant that is about to be toppled by an even more ruthless and superior competitor, China!   USA had a good run of 50 years at the top but covid, political divisions, autonomy is going to render our economy useless. We will see more protests in the next 5-10 years especially as technology leaves many as 3-4 million drivers (taxi, lorry etc) out of work and China will continue to see massive growths and form more and more alliances around the world with developing countries.  The biggest issue is that Americans are too busy squabbling amongst themselves to realise the severity of the threat.  More important to talk about pronouns and transgender toilets than working together and putting aside tribal politics to make the US great again!"
2020-06-27T22:10:28Z,"Who is to blame? The <b>VIRUS</b> is to blame Fox. You know, an independent organism devoid of political philosophy that exists. Provably a real virus killing people, actively.

2020-06-27T21:31:50Z,"Did you ever think no one is the blame? Who blames anyone for a common cold, the flu? Yes, take precautions - stop blaming people. We don‚Äôt even know IF China could have contained this highly contagious virus.<br><br>And to blame the President?!  What should we have expected when people came out from under their rocks that more people would catch COR 19. The media creates a PANIC as if something is different than we should expect."
2020-06-27T21:24:50Z,"Who&#39;s to blame?  The same people who caused the pandemic: The CCP and all the collaborator &quot;American&quot; politicians, media, and business elites who wanted those ties to China!"

He didn&#39;t say what the chances were if both were wearing a mask but he said if everybody wears masks the pandemic would be over far, far more quickly."

2020-06-27T00:11:28Z,BLM &amp; ANTIFA are 100% at fault in the spike in COVID 19.. You have thugs and worthless looters burning America in very large groups spreading the virus. Do you think all these morons were virus free when they started on this ignorant destruction of American history. The Dems/msm/blm and antifa are 100% responsible
2020-06-27T00:10:56Z,"Fox, cnn for conservatives. Like cnn it‚Äôs crap."
2020-06-27T00:01:55Z,The reason for the corona virus spike is because of the rioters and looters. They did not practice social distancing and they did not wear masks either. I have seen the rioters and looters not practicing it in Spokane. And what about the chop area in Seattle? Some have practiced some kind of caution. Wearing masks for one. But not most. And the drugs they take? A real good catalyst (one that starts) to the corona virus spike.
2020-06-27T00:00:15Z,"Who&#39;s to blame, it the states that haven&#39;t treated the virus as they should and allowed riots to take place, etc.   Those same persons go to New York, Seattle, Minnesota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania then come to the states that had low cases because they opened up and bring all their sickness to those states."

So, they will have to investigate those counties. I understand this virus is bad, so take precautions, wear a mask when around others and become responsible. Let‚Äôs work together and stop this scaremongering that some of the media channels are doing. Being infected doesn‚Äôt mean being dead yet they‚Äôre portraying it as if this is the case. Shame on them.  I found Fox News to be the most reliable news lately.

New york got out of that situation by ignoring trump and following guidelines to slow the spread. Stop shifting blame everywhere you know who spread false info on virus.

2020-06-26T21:19:22Z,The only thing that matters is the fatality rates are dropping. Which is why they changed their counting method to make it appear that it‚Äôs not going away. They are counting tests and not people. Many get false positives. If you had a regular cold/flu you will test positive. This is the best scam ever.

2020-06-26T21:03:19Z,The Chinese are to blame as they exported it here. It is very contagious and is bound to rise till we develop immunity to it or find a vaccine. The WHO and are own CDC did a lousy job of combating this as have all the experts involved. Many cases were likely there from the original out break and just now being detected as testing is more wide spread. Several studies have indicated that the number of actual cases has been under estimated by a factor of 40 to 80 and the deaths attributable to this disease has been drastically overstated. The left leaning media will promote the worst without regard for reality.

2020-06-26T20:27:04Z,So many people here who have no idea what they are talking about. Take the pandemic seriously or people will keep dying because of it.
2020-06-26T21:02:08Z,So-called authoritative figures rarely know what they&#39;re talking about either.  I&#39;m sick of bootlickers who think these people would never mislead you or are above reproach.
2020-06-26T20:26:11Z,We blame fox news for telling their audience that the virus is a hoax and encouraging them not to wear masks

2020-06-26T19:39:19Z,Cases are not rising. We are experiencing a second wave of testing.
2020-06-26T19:38:53Z,Polls have nothing to do with anything. I took a poll and found that everyone who is a Democrat has no idea who to vote for. Biden is not a choice for them. Biden is the last man on the deserted island there is no one else. They are leaving the deserted Island.

Need <br>transparancy, bet all the Red states got a ton of money up front and now<br> they want  more.    Places like hawaii got 120K per patient for <br>hospitalizations and Michigan on average recieved 32K per patient.  <br>Maybe we should ignore Red states cry for help and make fun of them like<br> they did the blue states.

2020-06-26T19:20:35Z,"Blame?  It&#39;s the media&#39;s fault! They keep making a big deal about something that was totally predictable,  the stay in-place did nothing to alleviate the virus. From day one, Hundreds of millions didn&#39;t use common sense to address the seriousness of that virus. No masks, no gloves , no social distancing and when the stay in place dropped the result was totally predictable.  The worst is yet to come. We all know who&#39;s blame, the idiot in the mask next to you with his nose sticking out,  no gloves, rubbing his eyes and nose."
2020-06-26T19:19:36Z,I HATE CLICK BAIT!!!!!!!!!
2020-06-26T19:18:25Z,Fox News is to blame.
2020-06-26T19:18:03Z,Oh and can someone tell Trump to stop lying to the American people. WE ARE NOT IN A BETTER PLACE.
2020-06-26T19:17:39Z,"This is a stupid question. Yes we can blame China, but how we dealt with it was also our fault. It was a combination of both political party, all the riots, Trump&#39;s rally, non-mask wearers, etc. Though if we wanted someone to blame, it would be Trump for not taking it seriously and getting his supporters to follow behind. He showed no concern about coronavirus probably cause he knows he has doctors around him at all times, so if the U.S. goes into a pandemic he&#39;ll be safe. Trump needed to send a clear message about COVID-19, but he shows he cares so little about it."
2020-06-26T19:16:27Z,Fox News and all the other media.. Pushing the fear mongering. They will continue to push this false narrative till we get a vaccine for the common cold.

2020-06-26T19:12:38Z,Your lack of professionalism doesn&#39;t help either
2020-06-26T19:12:28Z,Responsibility can only be asked if someone argued to open the economy against the doctors advice. If doing that you are partly responsible.

If we look at the successful nations we find one thing in common.<br>1. The closedown lasted until there was a large decrease in infections.<br>2. When the closedown was over there was a organisation in place for tracking the infection. The USA has not done one thing correct, Obama left a book where al this was written down, it is a pity that Trump does not read, as for Mike he reads the Bible and that might be a good thing in many situations, just not in this one."

2020-06-26T18:57:25Z,"Ill tell You what is to ‚Äòblame‚Äô:  the tests are hopelessly inaccurate and totally incapable of differentiating between any coronavirus including flu and the common cold which is why so many people are testing positive. I myself believe that the true numbers of infections and deaths are about a quarter of what we are being told and no one seems to account for the fact that 45,000 people die in the U.K. each month anyway but no one feels it‚Äôs necessary to close down the country for itüò°"

I won&#39;t be crying and screaming the world is coming to an end like you did November of 2016. And i dam sure won&#39;t be looting &amp; rioting in the streets.

Lockdown ends and the first thing they see on TV is a protest march where all the guys are shirtless and the girls are wearing halter tops and shorts.

2020-06-28T08:34:27Z,"Because it doesnt do anything. Taking preventative measures will reduce the cases in the future. How about taking responsibility in fixing the mess, regardless of whos to blame, instead of crying on who started it?<br>Because you know why they blame Trump and republicans? Because every single moment, Trump has a chance to be a responsible adult, volunteered and chosen to fix problems regardless of where it originated, and he doesnt. He just watches the mess spread. China did a mistake once and started to fix it. Trump refuses over and over again. China was responsible once, Trump has been to blame hundreds of times and still refuses to act."
2020-06-26T17:59:14Z,"Trump is precieved as weak and the rest of washington are in denial. We are in a Marist revolution and our country won&#39;t be here next year if they succeed.

2020-06-28T15:48:10Z,if we stay stuck with the virus we will never recover. Currently we are running at half speed and that might be better than 0 but is horrible for millions of folks. In the long run we will remain in a recession for as long as the virus cases are up.

2020-06-26T17:57:40Z,And of course we all know the polls are big lie like in 2016 Hillary was getting double digits and beating Trump by a landslide but who won? So you can never trust the polls they&#39;re not correct their skewed to try to make us believe that he&#39;s already lost so why go vote for him it&#39;s very stupid
2020-06-26T17:57:25Z,"To blame  ?  Why THICK Americans, of course."

This virus is no more deadly than last years flu.
2020-06-27T01:14:40Z,Surviving this virus doesn&#39;t mean you are without lifelong lung/ kidney/  cardiovascular  health issues. It&#39;s NOT A FLU. Recovery doesn&#39;t mean all health issues from COVID-19 are gone. Even asymptomatics can have health issues. Not having symptoms doesn&#39;t mean SAR2  didn&#39;t enter your lungs etc. Too early to tell what the longterm health issues once infected will be. SARS1 survivors struggle with serious  ongoing health issues.
2020-06-26T17:54:21Z,"You want to know who&#39;s to blame??? Mainstream media like you, spreading fear. The only reason there would be for a spike in numbers is because of more testing. All of those that are a wake now know that this virus is no more deadly or far spread than the normal flu. I know people that have or have had it.

2020-06-26T17:46:07Z,why are they acting as if there is any discretion behind pulling down statues..  The blax/globalists attacking our culture and history are ripping statues down because they hate western civilization and the European people who created and maintain it.. This is the DIRECT result of mass migration of racially/culturally alien outsiders into the west! Wake up!
2020-06-26T17:45:59Z,"Who the hell is this guy? I had to make a double take, I thought I was listening to CNN."
2020-06-26T17:45:49Z,"If there&#39;s any blame, it&#39;s the media trying to cause mass hysteria. Let me know when deaths start to rise. I don&#39;t care if millions of people in their 20s and 30s get something that won&#39;t even be as bad as the cold. Maybe it will help us get to herd immunity and we can stop locking down the entire population instead of protecting the vulnerable."

2020-06-26T17:45:35Z,I blame the people whose spreading the lies of all new spikes to scare people.
2020-06-26T17:45:17Z,"Why are we so concerned with the number of COVID cases? The number of moralities is what we should track and those are declining. If you argue that there is a direct correlation between cases and deaths I would say look again. Texas has had about 137,000 cases and 2300 deaths. Illinois has had about the same number of cases (139,000) and over 6800 deaths.  Massachusetts has had fewer cases than Texas (about 108,000 total) and over 7900 deaths. Michigan has had far fewer cases than Texas (about 69,000 total) yet Michigan has had over 6100 deaths. Likely the recent spike in cases is the result of younger people returning to work and being exposed. If that is the case, than the mortality rate will remain low."

2020-06-26T19:30:19Z,"I agree. I have no doubt this virus exists and is deadly to specific people with specific medical issues that cause compromised immune systems,  or in a specific age range. My issue with it all is how the federal and state governments handled it. They PANICKED. Shutting EVERYTHING down and imposing mandates that have damaged the economy and bankrupted small businesses, not to mention putting millions out of work....and forcing THEM into bankruptcy, homelessness, or even suicide."
2020-06-26T20:31:35Z,unnecessary crises created by missmanagement:  4% of worlds population but 30% of deaths.
2020-06-28T09:06:31Z,"This is a new form of the virus that the body does not recognize.<br>Its like you give a bouncer a list of names who cant get in, and then blame a conspiracy because someone completely new was let in and caused trouble because he was not on the list."
2020-06-26T17:30:43Z,"Who can personally stand behind the testing data, under the threat of perjury and prosecution?"
2020-06-26T17:30:34Z,Trump is killing America. Litterally. His policies is tearing and killing the country apart. RIP all who dies from Corona thanks to Trumps failure as a president.
2020-06-26T17:30:33Z,"WHO is to blame? Easy answer. The Communist Party of China. I suspect the Democrats colluded with the CPC, certainly with Marxist BLM/Antifa. Who is to blame for cases surging? Wrong question, as it assumes an individual is to blame for Covid-19, when the answer is a groups of individuals, just trying to live every day life, which they have the Constitutional right to. Why is the media freaking out about it? Confirmed cases are nothing to get excited about, and as for the fatality rate, it has already been confirmed by medical professionals, the numbers have been padded. The danger to children and healthy people is less than 1%. Fear mongering at this point is blatantly political."
2020-06-26T17:30:23Z,The rioters.
2020-06-26T17:30:09Z,I blame Bill Gates with his cohort Dr Falsey and China.

2020-06-26T22:07:48Z,"Tom Ackerman yes dopey , and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs starting to happen- the hospitals get overwhelmed when the infection rate skyrockets duh!!!"
2020-06-26T23:24:46Z,"How is this happening in 2 very warm states?    Republican states at that.  Because it‚Äôs being released again and again.  We were quarantined longer than incubation periods, according to the ‚Äú experts‚Äù."
2020-06-27T22:22:54Z,"Yes.  It is about slowing down the transmission rates until a vaccine is found, which could take years"
2020-06-27T23:59:41Z,@End of Days hmmm you will know who the devil is soon.

2020-06-26T17:28:00Z,The idiots that created conspiracies and the politicians that made it political are to blame. including yourselves.
2020-06-26T17:27:40Z,"Who to blame for corona virus, blame yourself and the president. It was a hoax, what you care about now?"
2020-06-26T17:27:30Z,"Reopen the economy and get people back to work. The riots/protests will naturally decrease, too, since many of the protestors will choose to make money instead of protesting."

2020-06-26T17:27:10Z,"yup protests, riots, dems, and stupid kids that have not been raised right."

2020-06-26T17:42:24Z,And reopening.
2020-06-26T17:42:27Z,"No mention of idiots who attend trump rallies with no masks?? In fact, no mention of right wing morons who refuse to wear masks cuz it intrudes on their freedom??"
2020-06-26T17:50:27Z,"real funny how there are huge outbreaks in republican controlled states and cities that haven&#39;t had huge protests, in fact the places with the large protests are actually going down in covid cases, maybe it actually is the GOP and trumps fault"
2020-06-26T17:51:09Z,I say it&#39;s bc of the ppl who chose not wear masks and protest with guns and without masks . Oh and we can&#39;t forget the police who don&#39;t wear masks too. Did you forget? Silly poo

2020-06-27T04:15:57Z,everyone is getting tested now...So yes! Cases will spike up.The difference is we won&#39;t see so many people dying from this.Many won&#39;t even feel sick! Yet positive cases will show and be told to the people to add more fear...Yes I do believe so much more is going on then what we see. The people with illness already willmore easily get this just as with any virus.The elderly too...

You need to get control of your socialists and reestablish rule of law.<br>Then you need to mend fences and come together again."
2020-06-26T17:24:56Z,Liberals and So Called Protestors are the Blame! As Well as the Media‚Äôs Spreading Lies

2020-06-28T07:30:23Z,"Media Spreading Lies is a basic right in a free country, one which Republicans fought for decades to achieve. Shackling media to one single view is a giant leap backwards, and to the left. You really hate Reagan that much that you would bring that hero&#39;s name to the mud?"

2020-06-26T17:23:07Z,Blame CNN

2020-06-26T17:20:12Z,We&#39;re getting a huge wave of the truth in Texas that the virus is way less deadly than the flu. We have a lot of people walking around not even aware that they have the virus it&#39;s just a safe thing all the way around because the less healthy are suffering.
2020-06-26T17:19:25Z,Chris more testing is being done that&#39;s why numbers are up. Antisytomatic. Open your eyes.

2020-06-26T17:17:38Z,The Media and fake numbers are to blame for the fake rise in cases!!
2020-06-28T08:11:05Z,"And the real rises in cases, greater than anywhere else in the world? You just gonna ignore those?"
2020-06-26T17:17:38Z,Protests are to blame. Spike did not occur 2 weeks after reopening...it started spiking almost exactly 2 weeks after protests tho...
2020-06-27T00:40:01Z,"Secondly, the amount of protestors went to the street are still nothing compared to the number of people who didn‚Äôt. They won‚Äôt really cause anything major"
2020-06-27T00:41:30Z,"Weird how the areas that are seeing the greatest spikes in the virus are conservative. Meanwhile, Minnesota, Illinois, NY, and many places with thousands upon thousands of protestors show decreases in cases. Testing more helps isolate those infected and in time, MORE TESTING HELPS FLATTEN THE CURVE"

2020-06-26T17:16:34Z,China is to blame ..<br>Who else ..
2020-06-26T17:16:21Z,All of this is a Circus and it&#39;s time to start looking at fixing our country.  What do you think was going to happen when you have these protests and people not wearing a mask and no distancing of the people. Covid-19 is going to spike... Duh  !!!

2020-06-26T17:11:25Z,I think preventative measures have been made pretty clear.  The virus has not gone away.  Nobody has said this. Take some personal responsibility. It isn&#39;t someone else&#39;s fault in 99 percent of cases if you catch it.
2020-06-26T17:11:11Z,Yeah just like the pole will Hillary was going to win by 98% you mean those pollsters you&#39;re still believing in those polls you&#39;re a moron just like Chris Wallace

2020-06-26T17:10:24Z,"MORE TESTING = MORE CASES.    Let&#39;s not be STUPID here.  It is ACTUAL CONFIRMED DEATHS FROM COVID-19  that need to be counted.  Not suspected deaths, not probable deaths or symptoms of COVID-19 deaths but a person who actually tested positive for COVID-19 who has died from COVID-19 deaths. That is what needs to be counted and what should matter.  If we test 100 million people (exaggeration)     in America, including people WITHOUT SYMPTOMS (which we are doing now) you are going to have millions that test positive.   DON&#39;T LET THE LIBERAL SOCIALIST DEMOCRATS AND THE MSM TELL THESE LIES AND SCARE EVERYONE.

Then, it was only the flu and only 15 people were infected. Let&#39;s not forget, Trump said it would go away when it got warm. In April, Pence said the virus would disappear by Memorial Day. Then in a negligent fashion on the direct stoking of Donald Trump, pressured Republican governors began reopening their states and here we are - surge of Coronavirus cases in Trump country due to the mismanagement of the pandemic by an unfit president who began having rallies in states that were seeing spikes in Coronavirus infections. And, finally Trump discouraging Americans from wearing masks and excoriating Democratic governors who were more responsible than their Republican counterparts.

2020-06-26T16:50:51Z,The statues are being taken down not because of any historical reference but because they are statues of white people.

When all the <b>things</b> that remind these people of whiteness have been removed then they&#39;ll go after <b>the only thing that remains which is  white.</b>  Do you need to even guess what that is?

Since we don&#39;t know the long term effects of Covid-19 as recovered patients who l had severe cases seen to also have organ damage, and the high mortality rate, waiting for the vaccine is the obvious way to do it. If we&#39;re lucky, we&#39;ll have one in five or six months."
