2020-08-26T09:46:14Z,"182,412 covid deaths 5,956,036 covid cases and counting even after the WH took control of hospital data from the CDC and test centres being closed down, 1000 americans are dying every day from the Trump virus, &#39;it is what it is&#39; says the impeached &#39;i dont take responsibility at all&#39; bone spurs grifter of a president who is responsible for 25 million people being evicted from their homes due to his incompetence...."
2020-08-13T18:18:42Z,"I love this little old man. He‚Äôs very right. The people that have no stakes in it shouldn‚Äôt be able to have the ultimate say. Players, coaches and athletic directors‚Äô opinion on the subject should hold more weight. After all, they‚Äôre taking the risk, they should have the say and take home the reward. Athletes are super healthy and far from risk anyway. Are sports also becoming tyrannical? Trump was right about the ratings dropping due to politics. Garbage."
2020-08-13T16:23:08Z,Sports in America have no interest in saving themselves. Many Americans will never return to watch or spend money on sports.
2020-08-13T04:31:04Z,Havent heard from Lou Holtz in a long time.
2020-08-13T03:37:17Z,I thought Lou Holtz was dead.....LOL Shucks..
2020-08-13T01:12:48Z,"What a delusional old man, comparing Normandy to college football lmao"
2020-08-13T01:07:19Z,Big mistake. They should sacrifice these young men and their future lung capacity. Let them die on the field. Let them play
2020-08-13T00:31:13Z,Smart Gentleman. Respect.
2020-08-12T23:58:18Z,Sports sucks anyway and close the schools.
2020-08-12T23:28:48Z,"Welp, the Kentucky Derby will be on TV on September 5th! üêéüá∫üá∏üê¥"
2020-08-12T20:47:33Z,There gona kneel for the anthem so nobodys going to watch
2020-08-12T19:22:51Z,"Personally I don‚Äôt see the big deal, come on let‚Äôs just play football!!"
2020-08-12T19:09:37Z,"No one cares about the NFL, end the NFL and the treasonous  cry babys. Tear down the stadiums across the country, that includes baseball and basketball. Stand for the flag or Go Away. Use the property for homeless."
2020-08-12T19:05:32Z,"No problem, I would not watch anyways."
2020-08-12T18:35:41Z,"Coronavirus is deadly serious.. take care everyone.. Rich ppl wanna send us working ppl to the killing fields, while they chill in their mansions"
2020-08-12T18:34:10Z,I&#39;m a conservative Republican..but I&#39;m thinking more and more of voting for Biden.. Especially after he picked someone as experienced as Kamala Harris (who was a tough on crime prosecutor) as VP..
2020-08-12T18:33:36Z,Lou HOLTZ I love you
2020-08-12T17:54:41Z,"Universities do not pay students to play, or when they get hurt. They&#39;re socialist at Universities, right? The university should pay players healthcare for life. They charge enough to pay."
2020-08-12T17:30:25Z,"My team is still playing, that‚Äôs all I care about and none of them have ever taken a knee"
2020-08-12T16:33:55Z,"Fox News needs to stop presenting Covid-19 as a binary outcome. There are many outcomes other than feeling fine or dying if you get infected. Even if you have no symptoms the virus can cause severe long-term damage to your vital organs. Also, if an infected football player (who doesn&#39;t even know that he is infected) spent some time with seniors such as Lou Holtz it could be fatal to the senior. All of the world seems to understand this danger except for Trump covidiots."
2020-08-12T16:01:49Z,"lets do it, ncaa isnt soft like the NFL"
2020-08-12T15:41:04Z,"Way to go, Coach! I totally agree; let them play."
2020-08-12T15:32:31Z,"i believe its all a hoax , as well as the coin shortage. the wealthy elites worldwide pulling the strings on  this caper for sure. politicians mere puppets of these evil people. God help us"

2020-08-12T13:53:47Z,This affects black athletes alot
2020-08-12T13:39:15Z,I don&#39;t care!!!!     I&#39;m sure that the SEC  will do the same.    Even with basketball.    See ya üñêüñê
2020-08-12T13:30:19Z,Let&#39;s be real. The University Presidents talked with their Lawyers and said that they can&#39;t be Liable for these kids.
2020-08-12T13:28:33Z,"At this point, the only way the Big Ten commissioner has a hope of saving his job is to backtrack on this ill-advised decision made without league consensus.   Even then it&#39;s 50-50 that he&#39;s not fired in 2021, but when the SEC and ACC have successful fall seasons, the Big Ten will be relegated to a podunk status that will take a generation to recover from."
2020-08-12T13:25:39Z,Football cancelled ?<br>Best news I‚Äôve heard all week !! üëè üëèüëçüèºüëå

2020-08-12T12:34:55Z,They need to shut down completely. Players have become to marxist
2020-08-12T12:19:52Z,"‚ÄúFollow God‚Äôs example, therefore, as dearly loved children and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God‚Äôs holy people. Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person ‚Äî such a person is an idolater ‚Äî has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God‚Äôs wrath comes on those who are disobedient. Therefore do not be partners with them.‚Äù"
2020-08-12T12:16:34Z,China should pay
2020-08-12T11:59:23Z,"President Trump said that the military is &quot;ready to go&quot; once a vaccine(s) is ready and authorized.   Why does the military need to be involved in administering a simple vaccine?  Perhaps it has something to with the nature of it?   Everything I read or hear about RNA, ties it to our DNA and nobody disagrees.  What sort of nightmare is this where our government is wanting to force DNA changing injections on the people?    Why is Fox News not talking about this?   Because they get paid not to, just like the others."
2020-08-12T11:51:41Z,Hot babes Sturgis giving it away Trump 2020
2020-08-12T11:43:55Z,No one cares about football any more. Cancel it for the rest of the year.
2020-08-12T11:38:57Z,Have everyone sign a liability release and play the dam games. It&#39;s all about being sued.
2020-08-12T11:37:27Z,Oh well I guess they&#39;ll all just have to learn to kneel next year

2020-08-12T09:51:04Z,Only sports worth watching are little league games. The kids play because the love the games. Hoping the future generations can bring the sports world back from the brink. Remember when sports was about sports? I do.

2020-08-12T05:01:25Z,"Nobody no nobody cares,  I will never watch another football or basketball or baseball game again. These leagues have proven that they are traitors to the American cause they have sold out to the Marxist that  are backed by the CCP of China ."
2020-08-12T04:41:51Z,Nobody wanted to see a bunch of millionaires on there knees anyways...
2020-08-12T17:52:09Z,Bro Big 10 is college. These students play for free...
2020-08-12T04:39:28Z,"Tons of disappointed football (and other sports) fans, but I am not one of them. Wokeness be damned while people find other hobbies to put their time and hard earned money into."
2020-08-12T04:24:22Z,Not as stupid as the NFL.
2020-08-12T04:20:17Z,Quarantine or not. We don&#39;t be want you anymore!
2020-08-12T04:16:08Z,Omfg here we goooo
2020-08-12T04:13:46Z,We&#39;re not interested in watching them.  Let them be &quot;woke &quot; and go broke.
2020-08-12T04:53:10Z,"I liked watching until it became all about money. Maybe this is a good thing. No money = Bring them back into reality for years to come. The cancel culture will surely weigh in on this too, and claim that the whole NCAA is racist, and should stay defunded. Wait for it."
2020-08-12T03:44:50Z,This is so ridiculous.  The College football season is done.
2020-08-12T03:42:32Z,Not a big deal I&#39;ve postponed football for the rest of my life. Take a knee to that

2020-08-12T03:37:40Z,They can blame the coronavirus but we all know they&#39;re losing money because of our boycott. Get woke go broke
2020-08-12T15:07:11Z,cancel culture is toxic
2020-08-12T03:37:10Z,"I think this is probably the right move to be honest. <br>As much as I love college football, the health and safety of the players matters.<br>Postponing the season until the spring is not such a colossal sacrifice.<br>I mean just from practices alone, there‚Äôs a school in my state that has had more than 30 athletes test positive. Going ahead with the football season as normal after that is just irresponsible."
2020-08-12T03:36:53Z,We can&#39;t keep hiding.

2020-08-12T03:29:24Z,"Keep taking a knee and u will be changing that suspension to an ending. Its a game, and politics is not a game. My money will never be spent on ANY game that tries to evoke a political agenda."
2020-08-12T03:27:26Z,My momma said fooseball is of the devil

2020-08-13T13:36:33Z,"@@studdruppo My friend and I used to drive through Wahoo on the way to her parents lake cabin in Fremont.  We used to shout &quot;Wahoo!&quot; When we got there.   I grew up in Elk Creek, NE.  Go Big Red!!!!"
2020-08-14T03:20:12Z,"@@heatherhillman7280 , I grew up in Lincoln but had a lot experiences around that area.   As a kid I would stay with my Uncle, Aunt  and cousins near North Bend. One summer out of High School I worked for Burlinton Northern as a gandy dancer putting in a railroad crossing near Wahoo.  But the phrase all the way to Wahoo Go Big Red came to me when I attended  a Nebraska game as a young boy and these inebriated farm boys kept yelling that out.  It&#39;s funny what you remember about your past."
2020-08-12T03:12:20Z,College and universities are beholding to the democratic party!!! They will do whatever the dems want them to do!!!
2020-08-12T03:10:40Z,YAY!
2020-08-12T03:07:22Z,See ya sports. They‚Äôd be kneeling anyhow. Saban and his BLM video says it all. We r all finding hobbies instead of watching others enjoy hobbies. Done
2020-08-12T03:03:09Z,The Big 10 became the Little 10.  The Washington Redskins became the Washington Wimps.  The PAC 12 packed their bags.  This is what happens when you bow the knee to the gods of rebellion and fear.  May they defeat themselves with their own foolishness!  Perhaps we are better off without sports and without the news!  Defund sports and defund the news!  If the cancel culture wants to cancel something cancel sports and news!

2020-08-12T01:39:34Z,"There is already good news. College Accreditation organizations say with athletes actually attending classes and not practicing and playing inter collegiate games, Fall 2020 will see highest number of college athletes in generations completing their courses which should lead to higher number of athletic graduates in 2021 through 2025. Professional sports organizations will create their own farming teams to pay a living wage, health insurance, and profit sharing and nurture young athletes who want to choose a professional sports path rather than college.  Professional football organizers feel this will finally remove the corrupt and exploitive elements from college sports, a billion dollar industry that exploits young students rather than invest in their future."
