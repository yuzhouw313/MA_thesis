2021-04-19T03:40:28Z,Look at the percentage of people that LIVE off of credit cards 43%.  That&#39;s no different than living pay check to paycheck.  Living within means helps alleviate some of the burden.

2020-04-12T07:49:18Z,Yet our society would blame these people for their circumstances.
2020-04-11T22:48:57Z,10%?   that might have been the number before the country went full Soviet and shut down a third of the economy.   They know it&#39;s closer to 40%.

2020-04-11T13:04:50Z,First off thanks to all the nurses and doctors for doing your job. With that said it grosses me out that our country thinks that we should feed doctors and nurses that have a job and are being paid. Over the furloughed people due to this virus or the people that need help because most of them live paycheck-to-paycheck. 1 out of 10 Americans are out of work right now. I am tired of seeing these fake news agencies along with s*** for brains celebrities and influencers pushing for feeding nurses over the truly needy.
2020-04-13T12:50:11Z,what? are you saying we shouldn&#39;t pay nurses and doctors?
2020-04-13T14:20:10Z,@@MohamedAli-nf1rp here in the United States nurses and doctors are paid by their hospitals that they work for. Hospitals are a private entity and we are not a socialist country. We should not feed people that are earning a wage. Especially when there are people not working that need to be fed. If the influencers and s*** for brains celebrities want to have a feel-good story wrapped around their name. They should donate a s*** ton of money to food banks and the non for profits that are helping the people in need.
2020-04-11T10:25:21Z,Sounds like they are saying only 10% of Americans lost their jobs.

2020-04-11T00:21:41Z,"March 12th fed bails out corporations with 1.5 trillion dollars stimulus package.

2020-04-10T22:04:53Z,"What&#39;s worse is California Governor Newsom is now crafting a coronavirus stimulus package for illegal immigrants. A question for Governor Newsom , Chuck Schumer and Nancy Policy,  Wouldn&#39;t that also include gang members of MS13. Crossing our borders undocumented or over staying their visas is still against the law. The media paints us a story of a poor helpless woman who has 3 young children to feed. But how would you separate that woman from a ruthless MS13 Gang member? They both have broken our laws and are both undocumented. So do you plan to give them both a check? Or can you explain how you would separate which illegal from the other illegal. I mean they both are undocumented. <br><br>Instead our elected officials didn&#39;t give any stimulus money to hard working Americans like college students who were claimed as a depended on their parents taxes nor did any 17 year old in high school.  Many hospitals have and are still recruiting college students to help fill the gap in hard hit hospitals during this pandemic. They did not even get any part of the stimulus money. But Nancy and Chuck are fighting to make sure MS13 gang members get a government handout.  That&#39;s a disgrace and people shouldn&#39;t stand for it anymore."

I think it&#39;s very one dimensional to just shut everything down.  I say a multi-dimensional approach would be to find a more balanced way to mitigate the severity of this, while still keeping employment solvent.  <br>We&#39;ve done it with SARS, ebola, H5N1, etc.  Outbreaks are not just once a century (more like once a decade or 2), but our reaction to this seems to be definitely once in a lifetime.
