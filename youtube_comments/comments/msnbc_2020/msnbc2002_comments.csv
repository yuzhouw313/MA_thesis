2020-03-29T18:46:21Z,Stop letting these people off..  make em wait 3 months..  if they infected they gonna go through isolation anyway at home..
2020-02-19T19:02:33Z,"Reality check!  I&#39;m not sure that the people on the ship, nor in the media understand the purpose of a quarantine.   It is to protect the people who are not on the ship from the people that are on the ship.  If no one in Japan contracted the virus from people on the ship then the quarantine worked."

2020-02-13T16:15:22Z,Being in a cabin won&#39;t stop the spread of a airborne virus.  Have they tapped every air duct?   Get real.
2020-02-13T16:13:10Z,Everyone on the ship has already been exposed.  No point in letting it spread further . Let it run it&#39;s course.  And no since in confining them to their cabins especially since they were exposed as soon as they boarded.  Duh!
2020-02-13T04:47:37Z,Abuse the crew - Vandalize the ship - Set it on fire if you have to
2020-02-12T05:21:44Z,Is it because this ship traveled to China or someone from wuhan China is on board?
2020-02-11T12:29:30Z,I hope all the corrupt democrats get the crown virus.

2020-02-11T10:27:13Z,"I live In japan... I think its tough to be stuck on that ship in fear but a ship is literally an Ideal quarantining facility especially after the fact that all those needing quarantine are already on board. Staff and hazmat teams are scrubbing and disinfecting the Entire ship outside private cabins routinely. They also turned off certain air circulation equipment as it is winter. Its not Ideal but Its not rocket science to figure out why this is the best option. it doesnt help that some people can carry it and recover without showing any symptoms, while infecting others..."

2020-02-10T20:35:35Z,Ventilation system is spreading it along with the sewage system! It will get worse before its over. This couple could be goners. They need to sink the Diamond Princess once the people are off to be sure it wont make anybody else sick.
2020-02-10T19:15:32Z,There so much NOT known about this Virus--if the person going back on board has a secondary infection and is continuing to take medications she should stay in quarantine in a special part of the hospital she&#39;s been treated at.  Going back to that Ship which clearly has infection on board is never a good idea.  Wow---this makes no sense
2020-02-10T19:11:09Z,After treatment go back on board!! WHY ???  If she is not a carrier why go back on board--why not just fly to China Wuhan and stay quarantined in a hotel room there.  Would not that make a little more sense.  Back on board--there is no way I would do that.

2020-02-10T18:58:40Z,The ventilation system of any and all Cruise Ships spread air borne viruses better than any other conventional way.  What the heck were those professionals thinking.  Get everybody of that death Ship and place them in quarantine where the bad air is sucked out.  I&#39;m sure Japan must have empty warehouses somewhere on that Island.

2020-02-10T13:46:15Z,"&quot;CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 22 million flu illnesses, 210,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 deaths from flu.&quot; way bigger then this coronovirus already, and we suffer through it yearly.....that is 2019<br>&quot;It is estimated that the flu results in 31.4 million outpatient visits and more than 200,000 hospitalizations each year. During the severe 2017-2018 flu season , one of the longest in recent years, estimates indicate that more than 900,000 people were hospitalized and more than 80,000 people died from flu.&quot; 2018<br>&quot;The overall burden of influenza for the 2017-2018 season was an estimated 45 million influenza illnesses, 21 million influenza-associated medical visits, 810,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, and 61,000 influenza-associated deaths&quot; 2017<br>I am not saying it is good people die, I am not saying that I am not sad that people die...but I am saying that people are over estimating this virus.....even IF it was in the several millions infected, it would be far less then the common flu, for contagion, AND death rate. Unless this latest coronavirus is doing something else...it is just another distraction from more important things <br>btw 12000 deaths in one flu season breaks down to (avg season 13 weeks=91 days 12000/21) 132 a day every day for a little over 3 months.-2019 death rate   (879 a day for 2018, 670 a day- 2017), please note that 2019&#39;s season is not over yet, so 12000 may be far short by the end...although we are closing in on the end as it stands.<br>Info freely available from the CDC and was my source material"

2020-02-10T08:55:19Z,Some people recover completely withon a few days with proper care but others can possibly get worse and get pneomonia 1-2 weeks later. Its at least roughly all numbers are &quot;roughly&quot; cause its still a new and ongoing virus but based off the doctors and scientists they all roughly say its about 20% of people infected eith it will develop pneomonia within 1-2 weeks later.

And stop being so freaking selfish as well, am guessing you were not complaining when the cruise ship industry was bringing millions of revenue to your country. Those people just want to go home, trust me they don&#39;t wanna stay in your country."

In the end it would be an emergency camp or some army camp/barracks. But also with the people locked in into the rooms like they are now...but way less comfortable.

You could look at the Scandinavian countries or probably most European countries.<br><br><br>But it&#39;s not that simple to implement. Taxes will be much higher so wages also have to be very high. That again means that the population needs to be highly educated, That again is super expensive = Higher taxes again.<br><br><br>You also need to attract businesses. They will expect high standards for childcare, security, infra structure etc. Again higher taxes.<br><br><br>You will get a lot. But you will also pay a lot. It can also be seen as very unfair. Maybe you&#39;ve never been ill or in need of a hospital? You&#39;re still paying for it. So on top of all that you also need a lot of trust among people and I think that is the hardest part. I&#39;m in a small country but I rarely leave my town. So I&#39;m gonna pay for someones prostate cancer treatment in Italy? Would be somehow equivalent to the distances you guys have over there.

2020-02-08T20:11:52Z,Anyone else remember the movie Contagion?
2020-02-08T21:47:20Z,Or the Stephen King book the Stand
2020-02-09T07:16:10Z,Only every second person commenting on corona virus videos for the past 2 weeks. Contagion and Plague Inc are vying for most referenced viral pop culture.
2020-02-09T07:22:22Z,And the movie &quot;Outbreak&quot;.  Scary stuff.
2020-02-10T06:30:26Z,"Watch Cassandra Crossing. 1970s movie with some huge stars in it like Sophia Loren, Martin Sheen, and OJ Simpson. A quarantined high class train in Europe not allowed to stop due to a virus in it."

2020-02-09T00:36:23Z,I read in a YouTube comment 2-3 weeks before the news media picked up the story of the wuhan virus. <br><br>Thank you for sharing your channel.
2020-02-08T20:08:57Z,So basically they are creating a new strain of virus once they treat them three days in the hospital and then fourth teen days back on the ship . Talking about being unprepared . Would it not be better to arrange a medical base operation outside the ship with a mobile medical setup .
2020-02-08T20:00:37Z,Hold up...she&#39;s getting back on after treatment?
2020-02-08T20:05:02Z,It&#39;s like they have no idea how disease works. Or they are intentionally trying to use them as guinea pigs not treat them.
2020-02-08T20:07:00Z,No you are just stupid. Once you have the coronavirus you cant get it again cause your body would have made special types of white cells to fight it off thus if you are exposed to it your body would easily remove it

2020-02-08T19:56:49Z,Seems airborne if this is the case
2020-02-09T01:40:15Z,It’s a virus that is spread by coughing and sneezing. It’s always been airborne from the moment it spilt over into humans.

2020-02-09T08:42:28Z,Please immediately bring your selfish white passengers onboard back to your country. Your whites just keep complaining to our Japanese govts even though all the support products have been covered by the tax paid by Japanese citizens. White passengers are unlike Asian passengers who express many thanks to Japan with those tangible and intangible supports provided by both the Japanese govt. and ship staff. <br><br>Whites are not hamble at all.
