2020-10-07T09:57:31Z,Ripping off that mask was the nail in his coffin.
2020-10-07T08:58:47Z,If Trump died there would be celebrating all over the world. Eddie van halens death and life was far more important than Trump....the world is mourning

2020-10-07T04:07:19Z,I dont think he was infected!
2020-10-07T04:01:23Z,"He was afraid. He panicked and got oxygen at the WH. Fear grew and he went to hospital. He&#39;s still afraid. Taking a drug not recommended unless the condition has got serious. Then there&#39;s the fear of losing the election, losing money. Losing his freedom."
2020-10-07T03:55:09Z,"Earlier months back he already told everyone (including those critically ill and have been diagnosed to have only a limited time of life) to get out to vote for him! He pleaded to Those about to die during election day to go out and vote for him too before they have their last breathe and he will honour them for their heroic deeds given to him! So now that he is a covid-19 carrier too.. He will still want to steal the election with the hope that he could recover to rule the world for another term! Then many of the Health Experts are worried about him been contagious as a spreader... To him.. Who cares?! Afterall he will not be the only one to suffer or die.. The more to be with him in that journey of death the merrier will be! That&#39;s the kind of madman he is. Afterall, American constitution had made such President a powerful King and NO ONE AMERICAN DARES TO OPPOSE HIS CRAZY RULE EVEN KNOWING HE IS WRONG? WHY ONLY BLAME THE PRESIDENT FOR CAUSING ALL THE CATASTROPHE IN THE COUNTRY WHEN NO ONE DARES TO STOP HIM FROM CONTINUING THOSE EVIL ACTS? INDEED A DESCENDENT OF SATAN WHO RULE THE COUNTRY!!ü§£ü§£"
2020-10-07T03:31:05Z,"anand giridharadas said it best: Trump hosted a super-spreader event to honor a justice who would have the government control your body but refuse the duty to care for it, and when the virus he helped go around came around, Trump availed of the healthcare he would deny others, financed by the taxes he refuses to pay."

2020-10-07T02:44:28Z,"I didn&#39;t hear any of the press rejoicing at the thought of Trump dying.   They were amazed at Trump&#39;s stupidity at the way he treated the disease after he came down with it.   It&#39;s as though he is tempting death itself to come get him.   The disease can be exceptionally dangerous, it is not the flu.  Many people have no problems with it but some have a terrible time with it and a few of those die a terrible death.   Trump is the cause of other people getting infected also.   Your comment is disgusting."

2020-10-06T22:19:25Z,This is a guy that thinks he is a king! Peachy is a &quot;hoax&quot; a &quot;fake&quot; most of all a joke. Impeachy has no shame no regard for anyone.

Not about all the innocent lives and loved ones who have succumbed to this virus with their lives.I can say with absolute I hate this man. He is not my president. A president?? I cant even say it. Ever. And I am patriotic &amp; Christian. Unbeleivable.
2020-10-06T22:05:54Z,If Immigrants killed over 200k Americans would he say don&#39;t be afraid or would he try to build a wall?

Our country made the mistake of throwing precautionary to the wind and now we have caught the 2bd wave due to our politicians own blunder. Now we are worse off then IN April with doubling the daily infections. We have a 1 year old death in one of our deaths yesterday. And now we may be facing a 2nd lock down."

The virus escaped from quarantine via the security guards who were hired to keep all returned citizens in their hotel rooms. It&#39;s taken 2 months of stage 4 lockdown to get things back under control. Is the virus too rife in the US to stop? It looks like it to me.

Wonder if Trump is able to make sane decisions. The doctor voice concern for his safety, but realize it goes with his work.

If he did then leaving the hospital may well be a fatal mistake.

Quit being so rude to the president."

He&#39;s now tested positive with the all too real possibility of having spread the virus to countless others through his selfishness prior to diagnosis. <br>Trump brought this on himself and he only has himself to blame due to his own arrogance and hubris. .It&#39;s not the past lies that is the issue, but the fact is; in the future everything Trump states will be suspect and questioned.  <br>Is this what we deserve as American Citizens?"

Now, all you lefty naysayers reading my post go ahead and jump with all four paws like the animals that you are and attack my justified opinion because Potus just proved that you need not be scared like the fear mongering leftist media portray."

2020-10-06T15:17:55Z,I seriously doubt he had Covid19.
2020-10-06T15:17:54Z,Let this be a lesson to everyone else who don&#39;t socially distance or wear masks. This is how bad and how fast it can spread if you don&#39;t take precautions to keep you and your family safe. Please be safe everyone!
2020-10-06T15:17:53Z,Thank you for mentioning that he has infected the entire white house. His leadership is a clear example why it&#39;s spreading. His supporters believe and respond just like him by refusing to quarantine.
2020-10-06T15:17:41Z,He is the worst human ever. Deranged and soulless.

2020-10-06T15:17:09Z,I have 100 doctors and hundred of tests just for me. Still I get it now. I know exactly what the average infected American is going through.<br>I have to go now. My helicopter is waiting to bring me to  my 5 star clinic.

But like the poor young man that passed away in Houston, that had gone out and partied, and as he died told his nurse, perhaps Donald will also admit someday, &quot;I think I made a mistake&quot;.

2020-10-06T17:36:41Z,"I was starting to believe it was a lie, that he just said he had it to gain sympathy, but watching him in this video pretending to be fine while it is clear he is struggling to breathe. I no longer believe he doesn‚Äôt have it. He has it and he is not out of the woods yet. I have seen COVID up close a relative of mine had it. That relative was coughing and achy. But that didn‚Äôt happen all at once it progressed. What I do doubt is the WH telling us the truth about how severe a case he has. It would have to be leaked in order for us to find out the actual truth."
2020-10-06T18:50:58Z,"Jhinu Jung That&#39;s why he has medical staff at the white house while he finishes quarantine there.  He was at the hospital for monitoring since they have better medical resources, but he appears to be stable/improving, which is why he left."
2020-10-06T19:06:19Z,"I thought the same as well until I saw him on that balcony. My husband and I both had the virus and his breathing, his color, oh yea, he&#39;s got it and it&#39;s worse than he&#39;s letting on because the high dose steroids are suppressing his immune system response for right now. Herman Cain died 28 days after getting the virus.."
2020-10-06T19:08:38Z,tmazz85 He actually left against doctors orders the doctor stated.. He only looks good because the high dose steroids are suppressing his immune system response at the moment.. My husband and I didn&#39;t crash until 5 days and 4 days after testing positive in April.. He&#39;s trying to act as if he&#39;s fine when he&#39;s not. Also he&#39;s not quarantining. He said he won&#39;t go to the West Wing and Oval office.. Meadows was in the room with him with Trump not wearing a mask but Meadows said he was.. This is wreckless!!
2020-10-06T19:13:04Z,"Jhinu Jung I am well aware it cannot be cured in 3 days. Did what I said imply that is what I meant? Because that was not my intent. All I was saying he isn‚Äôt telling us the truth (no surprise there). He has it, but is still trying to downplay its seriousness. Which is really sad, scary and if you think about downright evil."
2020-10-06T15:08:08Z,"Trump can tell everyone not to be afraid of the coronavirus for at least two possible reasons. First, his testing positive for the coronavirus could very well have been orchestrated by no one, but himself. Second, if he did actually contract mild symptoms of the coronavirus, he had the best possible experts to look after him. Even if the second scenario was to his advantage, how is that over two hundred thousand Americans died without adequate and much needed help? Trump didn&#39;t care the least bit to the plight of families and children who lost their loved ones because of Trump&#39;s lack of empathy, compassion and leadership? What kind of a monster does this to his own people? Everything that Trump puts up is a SHOW! He is such a pathetic and insecure individual &#39;crying&#39; and pleading for attention to ONLY himself! He is an overgrown cry baby! All the macho he is putting up is a camouflage to hide the mouse that he is!"

(Jer. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYwCyd0DtFI&amp;t=23m26s"">23:26</a>,¬†27) As a result, sincere individuals who think that they are worshipping God are deceived into worshipping demons.

For example, this system often teaches people that the best way to be happy is to pursue money and gather many possessions. (Prov. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYwCyd0DtFI&amp;t=18m11s"">18:11</a>) Those who believe this lie spend their lives serving ‚ÄúRiches‚Äù rather than God.

2020-10-06T14:51:33Z,"Psalm 77 <br>1 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. <br>2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. <br>3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. <br>4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. <br>5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. <br>6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with my own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. <br>7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favorable no more?  <br>8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? <br>9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. <br>10 And I said, this is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. <br>11 I will remember the works of the Lord: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. <br>12 I will meditate also of all of thy work, and talk of thy doings. <br>13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God? <br>14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. <br>15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. <br>16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid; the depths also were troubled. <br>17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. <br>18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. <br>19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. <br>20 Thou leadest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron."

2020-10-06T14:45:47Z,"But of course, Trump was breathing heavily - that&#39;s what happens when someone wears an unsafe cloth mask which can not effectively stop/block any virus. The cloth mask only reduces the oxygen intake which causes labored breathing or stress on the lungs (which is why it feels like you just ran up a long flight on stairs when you wear a cloth mask).  &gt; Come on, People - be honest with yourself. Do you feel like you are having to work harder to breathe when you wear a cloth mask, especially when you exercise &quot;as in briskly walking across a grassy field and then up a flight of stairs with the entire world watching&quot;?  I think most people would agree their breathing is labored, meaning harder to breathe. This is due to less air intake as a result of the physical blockage or filtering of the air by the cloth mask - thus when we have less air &quot;we have less oxygen intake&quot;. It&#39;s that simple - simple deductive reasoning and math,  ~and a little intellectual honesty!"

Had he got this as a civilian he likely would have had a more difficult time.  Trump and 14 of his staff got the disease and raised his his own statistics.  Why dont they put him on a ship offshore and keep them out of the US stats that make him look bad.  Just like his comments on the 100s of US citizens stuck on a cruise ship in Los Angeles back in Feb. March."

South Korea currently has had only about 400 coronavirus deaths and their economy is running at 90% without ever having a lockdown. In contrast to Mr Trump&#39;s plan, which is to put blame for his inaction on others, the South Koreans are building their country stronger so they can compete against China. FoxNews is in a large way responsible for the extra 100,000 deaths here in the US because of their promotion of division and the anti strategic &quot;America First&quot; religion."

She died the day before my birthday.<br><br>I myself entered the hospital with pneumonia in April, and was tested and found to be positive. I was there for less than a week - it was a mild case, didn&#39;t need any serious drugs - but when I got home, I kept my mask on whenever I left my bedroom, and gloved up whenever I had to handle anything; so did my brother, who had to do the cooking. And the effects of it will be lasting. Since August, I&#39;ve had a bit of breathing trouble; I went and got retested to make sure it was not another round of the virus (it wasn&#39;t, I tested negative), and I remembered that they said lung damage was one of the long-term effects.<br><br>This performance made me angry. My family and I have suffered - two of that 210,000+ death toll lived in this house at the start of the year, and are now in urns sitting in the china cabinet - and yet this man chooses to dismiss our suffering just because the virus finally caught up with him, and he continues to say it&#39;s no big deal, and to not be afraid of it.

He is showing the world that regardless of his age and condition he is still willing to fight for America!   He was making a statement of strength and the will to keep going.  I am sure that once he got into the building he put his mask back and all precautions were taken to keep everybody safe.
2020-10-06T14:40:56Z,Trump never had Covid-19 and neither does the Republican Senators that wanted to shut down the Senate so that Amendment 25 could not be invoked for Trump not being able to fulfill his duty if he has Covid. This guy is still conning America.
2020-10-06T14:40:52Z,"Trump lies again!   This time telling people not to be afraid of the coronavirus!   He puts all of at risk with that lying statement!<br>He is reprehensible, deplorable and despicable!    He cares nothing for the lives of Americans!   Covid19 is deadly and we should be afraid and avoid interacting with others!!    Trump is irresponsible  but then he did say that he takes no responsibility  didn‚Äôt he?   <br>Vote thIs political monster out and get this horrid man out of public life!    Irresponsible and highly reprehensible!<br>,"

2020-10-06T14:40:22Z,You know the president is doing the right things when the socialist left democrats continue their name calling. Aren&#39;t you people due another poll to make you feel good about something since losing is the only consistency you&#39;ve been accustomed to?
2020-10-06T14:40:08Z,average American ‚Äì don&#39;t be afraid of Covid! Three days in the hospital will cure you and drive you into bankruptcy.

He hardly ever wears a mask, is exposed to people from all over the world literally, and it took him 8 months to catch this virus.  It&#39;s bad, but it&#39;s not a death sentence like the whackamoly liberals have been pushing, all as a political stunt, that is not going to work.  Trump just proved all of you wrong in so many ways, and you try to gloss over that.  I predict, the day after the election, this virus will disappear pretty much.  Liberals are off the rails.  TDS is real.  So is Red Kingdom though, get ready."

The gave covid the deaths but those people who died had other health problems.maybe covid sped up their death but if you look at it these people could have died from that other health problem but since they contracted covid we are giving covid that death.please put right number out which are the people who died just from covid which is way under 20,000.i hate you liberals that look past what trump have done and still doing and just bc covid he is so terrible.ill tell you no matter who sits in the White House they are going to do worse than trump and if we let Biden in there you guys will see we are screwed"
2020-10-06T14:33:53Z,"Incorrect. You&#39;re falling for a piece of propaganda which was designed to trick you. Ask any medical doctor about how you are wanting to count covid deaths and see if it makes sense to him or her.<br><br>If someone has asthma for 50 years, gets covid and dies 3 weeks later on a ventilator, it&#39;s not the co-morbidity that killed them, it&#39;s the covid-19.<br><br>Also using the logic of this argument you have absorbed, nobody has ever died of AIDS. AIDS is not fatal because it merely destroys your immune system and then you die of pnemonea when you get a cold. It&#39;s not the AIDS that killed them, it&#39;s the cold. Therefore AIDS is not deadly."

Regardless, the fact remains that most Americans don&#39;t have dedicated medical teams there to look after them with the best everything that tax money can pay for.

To hear his side often reminding people, supposedly what Trump says is routinely misinterpreted and taken for something else it also sounds like it could have meant instead.

There is a lot to be afraid of. Clots, chronic fatigue, joint pain, brain fog, IBS, shortness of breath, persistent cough, chest pain, headache, and the list goes on. You can get these symptoms even if you get a light case of the disease. There are so many people experiencing extended symptoms that they call us, &quot;long haulers.&quot; And every new virus, like a common cold, can magnify the long-haul symptoms. No one knows how long these symptoms will last but people, who have gotten other viruses, have experienced debilitating symptoms for years. So don&#39;t believe Trump.

2020-10-06T14:11:01Z,"Trump is correct, we should plan and use common sense but quit with the panic.  With the CCP providing nothing but lies in the beginning (one thing that they said that was truthful, the seniors and those with other conditions were vulnerable, but we had several Democrats Governors that refused to heed that one, didn&#39;t we) I do not fault with the initial lockdown.  SARS and MERS had very high mortality rates and this virus that came out of a Chinese Lab was a close cousin (Democrats have yet to call them out on this, if they had not tried to hide the virus you would have had containment)  However, the CDC nor NIH did their job (both are made up of career Federal Employees)  they should have started collecting data and within six weeks would have started allowing all to return to work.  Too many infected by TDS.  Quit only taking in what your are being told, check out the number actually be hospitalized now and the number of deaths.  They should only be testing those that present for medical treatment.  Lets look at the death numbers.  The Democrat Governors that told nursing homes that they had to take  Covid patients are responsible for about 30,000 of the deaths, those that fought the use of HDQ are responsible for about 40,000 to 60,000 deaths for studies are now showing it improved the status of about 30% of those treated with the cocktail.  We now have a generic that is said to be better."

As far as the super spreader event no one told those people to go to this event and not wear a mask, each and every one of those people are responsible for their own health and should have known better than to go to an event like that without wearing a mask so again you can&#39;t point the finger at one person and say they&#39;re at fault.

Not saying Trump shouldn&#39;t have taken more caution, but I do not think it is very professional to go around and blame everything on him. Don&#39;t want the virus? Stay home. Don&#39;t say Trump is the one going around causing people to become infected with COVID when it is honestly on the responsibility of the citizens of this country. While there are circumstances that could be taken to prevent the spread (nursing homes for example), it is still largely on the responsibility of people to take COVID seriously. And before I get any hate, I lost my great grandmother to COVID, yet I do not blame our president for it. I know the pain of losing someone to this virus, but it is not related to Donald Trump in any way. I think as a country we need to get rid of this &quot;blame the president for everything&quot; ideology, it is tearing us apart as a nation. People seem to blame Trump for anything, they could get a paper cut and it&#39;d be Trump&#39;s fault. While Trump is by far not the best president we have ever had, he has done some good things that go unrecognized by the media. It is not right to blame everything on  Donald Trump."

I never said whether the President was right or wrong--he SHOULD take all precautions WHILE holding office. If he&#39;s not capable of making &quot;decisions&quot; then the competent individuals before him should assist in his/her shoes.

Heart, liver, kidneys, all these organs can have problems right from birth, but you won&#39;t have visible symptoms, yet the person can be on medication be or just never felt symptoms to have gotten put on treatment.  So many things that COVID-19 can amplify and make many times worse or straight up turn to a death sentence.  The difference between Trump and us commoners is he has dozens of doctors to treat him at a moment&#39;s notice, personal ICU on our tax dollars, gets to benefit first off of the guinea pigs that tested these medications to treat COVID-19, etc.  Do you think because he&#39;s fine, you see him huffing and puffing, the rest of us will be?"

They‚Äôre typically morbidly obese, but not always, and they don‚Äôt exercise. Same with the risk factor of hypertension. Hypertension in and of itself isn‚Äôt a risk factor.

2020-10-06T15:11:14Z,"‚ÄúThe masks on walks outside and while driving in your car is mind blowing to me. Do you not know how unhealthy it is to keep inhaling your carbon dioxide and restricting proper oxygen flow? I honestly cannot believe how non-logical we have become! We as a society seem to just listen to (perceived) authority without question. I don‚Äôt see a whole lot of critical thought happening here, I‚Äôm sorry to say. Why I opt NOT to wear a mask. Well, let me break it down for you. The body requires AMPLE amounts of oxygen for optimal immune health. Especially during a so-called ‚Äòpandemic‚Äô. Proper oxygenation of your cells and blood is ESSENTIAL for the body to function as it needs to in order to fight off any illness.<br><br>‚ÄúMasks will hamper oxygen intake. Unless you are working in a hospital setting, it is NOT necessary. But go ahead and hold onto to your security blanket if it makes you feel better. I do not listen to the government when it tries to instruct me on how to maintain health, nor do I trust their ‚Äòstats‚Äô (which we know are based on unconfirmed numbers).<br><br>‚ÄúYou want to be healthy, then make sure to apply it to all aspects of your life. Stop smoking, change your diet, stop consuming alcohol, turn off your wifi and cell phone, stop getting injected with neurotoxins, stop taking toxic medications, stop using so many chemicals in your everyday life, practice proper hygiene (WASH YOUR HANDS). Most importantly, go outside and BREATHE DEEPLY, get some sun, drink plenty of (filtered) water, sleep well and learn to LISTEN to your body.‚Äù"

What if the President, and his select few already decided they were going to apply the &quot;Herd Theory&quot; despite what any other person thinks? What if this was his solution and no one is going to have a choice in the matter. What if he actually planned on using this as a weapon during the debates? Or is planning to use this as a weapon to cause the dems to look bad causing them to back down from debates? Is Kamala Harris going to be safe? What if I&#39;m giving him too much credit now and he hasn&#39;t planned this, but realizes he and his supporters are a biological weapon? What if Putin is mobilizing right at this moment to support his base? I&#39;ve seen Breitbart getting more agressive and others.  Militarily, by the internet, biologically(is there nerve agent in the U.S.)we don&#39;t know. I think we need to treat Trump as a traitor and arrest him. This has gone far enough. We need to face the facts. Trump is facing the fact of rotting in a Federal Prison and he won&#39;t spare a single person on the entire earth to insure it doesn&#39;t happen. Also the Russians are involved with the campaign under the guise of Australia News. Of course their intentions are to cause a rift between these two allies. He clearly violated his oath on Americans. On this basis we can impeach and charge him."

2020-10-06T13:36:56Z,A word of advice to DT.....A close relative of mine came into contact with a positive person unknown to him. He was traced a week later and quarantined in hospital. A few days later he was showing mild symptoms which were treated. A few more days later he was put in an induced coma and placed on a ventilator. He is 65 and diabetic. Over the next three weeks his wife was told to say her goodbyes twice. She was tested positive but recovered after mild symtoms. He recovered but it will take him a minimum of two years to fully recover.<br>Your President is irresponsible and dangerous....you know it the world knows it and every American should know it now.

2020-10-06T13:36:55Z,My uncle died of Covid. I&#39;m in the high risk group to get it. My uncle as well as i am telling you DON&#39;T BE AFRAID! You mean the less then 1% of the population which makes it an insignificant number of infections and deaths. Covid been around almost a year and less then 1% isn&#39;t a bad number. Car accidents rank higher we gonna stop driving. I&#39;m a veteran my uncle&#39;s a veteran and we joined to protect our rights to choose whether to wear any masks that don&#39;t work or not. Remember yall said it best you wear a mask to save others so i should be good to go since yall keep wearing yours. It&#39;s funny that those masks yall push say right on the box they don&#39;t protect against viruses. They&#39;re like wearing a condom with holes stabbed through it. I can hear yall now it may be letting in stds and letting out pregnancy but at least your covered.  All i had from this report is a bunch of adults crying because they thought they&#39;d get to run in trumps and everyone else&#39;s face how bad covid is and here the president does a couple days and boom all clear. Bank on this you&#39;re getting 4 more years of trump God has already put that out there. Mock me now if you like i don&#39;t care but remember on Nov 3rd you read it here first!

If he isn&#39;t on a ventilator, he&#39;s lying. This has been staged from the get-go. (Joe thinks that b/c he was short of breath after climbing the stairs, that&#39;s proof. It&#39;s proof he&#39;s obese and out of shape. That&#39;s it.) Ivanka came up with the Bible-pose idea. This is probably her brainchild."

But this past year changed everything for me seeing him standing for the photo opp with the Bible. The list goes on... You mentioned saluting a marine. Go back and take a look. Trump stood there sucking up his saluting photo opp on the balcony but look before that as in when he was stepping off the helicopter. He did not salute the marine who was standing there saluting him. Total disrespect I felt. The only reason I&#39;ll give him a pass on that is because he is allegedly sick.

2020-10-06T13:31:10Z,"Back to business, I get very frustrated and annoyed when I watch these rallies and people downplaying Covid-19.  Some describing it as a mere bout of influenza.   It is not about getting over Covid-19 once contracted which is the issue here, but it is more about the wretched aftermath and what it does to the human <a href=""http://anatomy.to/"">anatomy.To</a> not remain prudent and taking care at all times even when Covid cases are gradually diminishing would be detrimental to ourselves, and those we come in contact with.   Basically what this virus is about is more akin to  playing Russian Rouelette in  sense.  We all react differently as individuals as to how we cope and some cope relatively well, yet others not so much.   This latest report makes for discerning reading.  I am not leaving a link as many won&#39;t bother checking that out and rightly so as I understand we&#39;re all sick to the hilt about Covid and prefer to stay optimistic, but not when it overshadows the realities of how damanging Covid&#39;s aftermath havoc can wreak on us now and generations to come.  It weakens the human strain and breaks us down as a species as has been shown throughout history, hence why there are so many diseases that are some of the most common once which will get us all sooner or later. How much longer can any of us cope with this thing and how long will it be before the economic negative affects will ultimately affect the entire world is anyone&#39;s guess, but we just battle on bravely and do our best.  But in life I have learned one most important thing and that is, its not about material things or wealth or what we accumulate in our lifetime.  It basically and simply really boils down to just one thing: If we have our health we have everything.  ‚ÄãBy Mayo Clinic StaffCOVID-19 (coronavirus): Long-term effectsCOVID-19 symptoms can sometimes persist for months. The virus can damage the lungs, heart and brain, which increases the risk of long-term health problems.Most people who have coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recover completely within a few weeks. But some people ‚Äî even those who had mild versions of the disease ‚Äî continue to experience symptoms after their initial recovery.Older people and people with many serious medical conditions are the most likely to experience lingering COVID-19 symptoms. The most common signs and symptoms that linger over time include:FatigueCoughShortness of breathHeadacheJoint painAlthough COVID-19 is seen as a disease that primarily affects the lungs, it can damage many other organs as well. This organ damage may increase the risk of long-term health <a href=""http://problems.video/"">problems.Video</a>: Long-term symptoms, complications of COVID-19Organ damage caused by COVID-19Organs that may be affected by COVID-19 include:Heart. Imaging tests taken months after recovery from COVID-19 have shown lasting damage to the heart muscle, even in people who experienced only mild COVID-19 symptoms. This may increase the risk of heart failure or other heart complications in the future.Lungs. The type of pneumonia often associated with COVID-19 can cause long-standing damage to the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The resulting scar tissue can lead to long-term breathing problems.Brain. Even in young people, COVID-19 can cause strokes, seizures and Guillain-Barre syndrome ‚Äî a condition that causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson&#39;s disease and Alzheimer&#39;s disease.Blood clots and blood vessel problemsCOVID-19 can make blood cells more likely to clump up and form clots. While large clots can cause heart attacks and strokes, much of the heart damage caused by COVID-19 is believed to stem from very small clots that block tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the heart muscle.Other organs affected by blood clots include the lungs, legs, liver and kidneys. COVID-19 can also weaken blood vessels, which contributes to potentially long-lasting problems with the liver and kidneys.Problems with mood and fatiguePeople who have severe symptoms of COVID-19 often have to be treated in a hospital&#39;s intensive care unit, with mechanical assistance such as ventilators to breathe. Simply surviving this experience can make a person more likely to later develop post-traumatic stress syndrome, depression and anxiety.Because it&#39;s difficult to predict long-term outcomes from the new COVID-19 virus, scientists are looking at the long-term effects seen in related viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).Many people who have recovered from SARS have gone on to develop chronic fatigue syndrome, a complex disorder characterized by extreme fatigue that worsens with physical or mental activity, but doesn&#39;t improve with rest. The same may be true for people who have had COVID-19.Many long-term COVID-19 effects still unknownMuch is still unknown about how COVID-19 will affect people over time. However, researchers recommend that doctors closely monitor people who have had COVID-19 to see how their organs are functioning after recovery.It&#39;s important to remember that most people who have COVID-19 recover quickly. But the potentially long-lasting problems from COVID-19 make it even more important to reduce the spread of the disease by following precautions such as wearing masks, avoiding crowds and keeping hands clean.ShareTweetAug. 18, 2020Show referencesSee more In-depthProducts and ServicesCoronavirus map: Tracking the trendsSee alsoShow more related contentCan COVID-19 (coronavirus) spread through food, water, surfaces and pets?COVID-19 and vitamin DCancer treatment delays due to COVID-19Safe cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemicConvalescent plasma therapyCoronavirus safety tips for going outCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>MAYOCLINIC.ORGCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) - Symptoms and causes"

Abortions are killing God&#39;s creation and God isn&#39;t pleased with this! Innocent children&#39;s blood are on everyone&#39;s hands who believe in it, What has happened to our country?? This country was founded on God, the Bible and the 10 commandments, and our constitution, and our country is going to have to put God first!

But he is even more afraid of losing the control of the WH to anyone else. Not even Pence for a while.   At this point in his life, the Presidency is what supplies him any sense of relevance and his ego dwells on to mitigate his colossal failure as a Businessman.  <br><br>He can&#39;t, and is not willing to, share the clout the Office of the Presidency confers on anyone.

2020-10-06T13:11:49Z,"According to Australian doctors and medical researches, there is no need to be afraid of covid if one uses ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine with their respective cocktail of antibiotic and zinc at an early stage.  They also say there is no need for a vaccine if these drugs are used, because vaccines are not necessary or used when there is effective medicine - which there is."
2020-10-06T14:19:09Z,"Ivermectin, the stuff I give my animals?  Lol. Didn&#39;t know I had the cure in my cupboard."
2020-10-06T14:29:47Z,"@@Sryously If we give our dogs penicillin, it doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t take it ourselves.  Ivermectin has been around for a long time as an anti-parasitic, including of the GI tract, which explains why it might be also given to dogs.  But, go on Youtube and check out the videos and credentials of those being interviewed.  I agree that no on e should buy this sight unseen.  But, those of us, who have had to use chloroqine often to prevent malaria, have never been told about dangerous side-effects until now.  in fact, no one I know who&#39;s used it have ever suffered those effects.  It is true that years of use can cause loss of vision and hearing, but that is all any of use have heard prior to covid."
2020-10-08T01:51:40Z,"look it up Well, maybe the Australian doctors and Australia&#39;s medical researchers should not believe their lying eyes and research..  I had to take chloroquine many time for my work in malarial territories in the Bolivian and Brazilian Amazon, Haiti and South East ages.  I know many who have taken this drug for years.  Yet, none of us were aware of the dire side effects that Fauci, the CDC and the FDA have been warning about.  But maybe we who used it without these effects shouldn&#39;t believe our lying eyes either.  By the way, what I wrote, look it up."

On covid  TRUMP  has used placebo messaging in a positive manner by encouraging us not to be fearful . The democrats and media try to down play Trumps positive messaging /  Voodoo  is the negative aspect of the placebo effect. That is the messaging of both Democrat leaders and the media they use fear to fight Trumps positive messaging . You  believe something hard enough Faith it can be accomplished. Voodoo works same exact way. Using VOODOO  KILLS PEOPLE USING POSITIVE MESSAGING CAN SAVE LIVES . Doctors use it all the time with meds and positive messaging and its proven to work . TRUMP  messaging is positive = Good    Democrat leaders and media send out negative messaging that can lead both to sickness or death= Bad

2020-10-06T13:07:33Z,Even Olivia Troye said something about this yesterday she said that Donald Trump and Mike Pence will stop at nothing to get Donald Trump back on the campaign Trail and she thinks that&#39;s what this is all about the news reporter said even though he&#39;ll infect people she says he&#39;s already infected people he doesn&#39;t care the only thing that Donald Trump cares about is Donald Trump that&#39;s the reason why she got out of the white house because she was afraid of her of her while being in her family while being and then she said do you think Donald Trump will go back on the campaign Trail and then Olivia Troye said I know Donald Trump wants to go back on the campaign Trail he can see it he wants to go back really bad why you think you got in that SUV Donald Trump wants to go back on the campaign Trail WOW and then I was watching this and I just got a chill down my spine this man is going to try anything to get about on the campaign Trail WOWüò≥ü§îüòéüò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑üëΩ

2020-10-06T13:31:30Z,But 5-times he FEARED the VIET-CONG and claimed a &quot;Heel-$pur&quot; exemption 5-time.  He said the Army is for &quot;Suckers and Losers&quot; Trump and his kind have NO-RESPECT for Army Veterans.

2020-10-06T13:06:38Z,"At this point, I feel the deepest compassion for the anchors on all the shows discussing this megalomaniac.

We need to come up with an award for &quot;Journalistic resilience under lies&quot;."
2020-10-06T13:06:33Z,"Well, normal people don&#39;t have access to experimental medecines and don&#39;t have a team of doctors watching them 24 hrs a day... So Trump may feel safe but it&#39;s far less safe for the common folks."
2020-10-06T13:19:00Z,Andy Taylor yep. I think the only people that should worry about the virus are those with respiratory conditions or other problems that might get you in real trouble if you catch it. Healthy people will likely get thru this virus like any common flu.
2020-10-06T18:41:34Z,Andy Taylor I know covid will make it worst for those with certain conditions and push them to the grave a little early. So they likely die of their own pre existing condition worsened by covid. It is still a death cause by covid cuz the person might have had a year left without it? 5 years? who knows...
2020-10-06T13:06:23Z,I‚Äôm a liberal but Joe drives me crazy. Can‚Äôt stand him.

2020-10-06T13:06:21Z,"I chose to NOT be afraid.  My God is kind and loving and I fear Him not, I respect Him.  I am not afraid of the devil and I do not fret over any illness I may encounter.  I am proud of my lack of fear.  With Chinese Corona, if I suffer with that, I shall suffer with the least amount of bother to my fellow beings.  Patient autonomy rules!"

2020-10-06T13:06:17Z,Last night was Trump being Trump on steroids.
2020-10-06T13:06:11Z,Have y&#39;all seen Jordan play with the flu/food poisoning? He is strong minded. If he dies he dies but everyone is being a soft. People die from the flu too and I&#39;ve been worse from the flu than covid and I got a short fever twice this year that lasted less than 24 hours and so did my daughter that isn&#39;t two yet. I haven&#39;t tested for it but y&#39;all are just unhealthy who are dying from this. Go start cycling twice a week and move on to 4 times a week to get your health back lames. It&#39;s stupid for y&#39;all to think that being unhealthy in anytime of your life is a smart thing to do. Anyone dead from covid is their fault.
2020-10-06T13:06:09Z,"This is simply trump showing ONCE AGAIN what a low life, despicable person he is."
2020-10-06T13:06:08Z,"To all my non-wearing masks üò∑ Republicans that are Christians it is written that you should not tempt our Lord God. Putting yourself and others in harms way is testing the Lord. You know better. Job was not spared and God loved him. <br>Matthew 4:1-11 KJV<br><br>Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.<br><br>KJV: King James Version"
2020-10-06T13:06:03Z,He is shaking in his boots about the potential consequences of defeat. Let&#39;s make sure his nightmare comes to true.

2020-10-06T13:06:02Z,"I know that MSNBC is a commentary network,  but the male in the middle is behaving like a whiny 5 year old.  It would be better for him to communicate with clarity and confidence instead of whining and name calling.

2020-10-06T13:05:43Z,"total fake, he never had it.  What he DID have was a disastrous debate,  his tax starting to surface, Melania&#39;s tape saying she doesn&#39;t five an F about xmas or children in cages, more indictments...  This was - and continues to be - a nice distraction"
2020-10-06T13:05:41Z,Hahaha you guys believe these propaganda pushers. Oh my goodness he made the photographer go over there near him to endanger her. Shat the fack up oh my the numbers so many dead. Shat da fack up. People like these are why we have high facking numbers.

2020-10-06T13:05:22Z,We all knew that he was going to do this! He wants to be strong for his people so that&#39;s why he took of the mask. He is still sick and what he is doing is that he is spreading the virus that is still in him. Not be afraid of the virus he says! Tell that to over 200 thousand people we have lost because of this virus. The worst thing the president has done now is taking the mask off after coming out of the hospital while still having the virus.
2020-10-06T13:05:18Z,What Americans should be afraid of is all the lamestream media BS.
2020-10-06T13:05:17Z,bias

2020-10-06T13:22:59Z,Or the fact that COVID isn&#39;t nearly as deadly as reported...especially if you catch COVID and are healthy outside of that.

2020-10-06T13:04:40Z,He is saying to not be afraid because he did not have it to begin with!!
2020-10-06T13:04:33Z,trump please dont bull crap over the people suffering due to covid19. you had the best in class medical treatment and well in advance detection of covid19. dont compare your situation to rest of us Americans.
2020-10-06T13:04:31Z,He NEVER HAD IT
2020-10-06T13:04:28Z,Trump is not known for accurate predictions.  He is known for dishonesty and denial. His words put citizens‚Äôs lives in danger and he shows no remorse. His brain is just not working right. I am not sure it ever did.
2020-10-06T13:04:27Z,Trump was breathing like Darth Vader up on that balcony. The Helicopter flight was filmed like Apocalypse Now but turned out more like OJ&#39;s white Bronco chase - the criminal was trying to get away..

Did you miss the cdc announcement about the numbers being maybe 6% of what has been reported because hospitals were tagging everything covid? My in laws tested positive for it, they are in their 70s. It was basically the flu. And it is hilarious you call conservatives cultists when leftists actually had kids singing Obama praise songs lol. Real easy to verify."
2020-10-06T13:35:23Z,"J 2....very few hospitals were full but they couldn‚Äôt take furniture with a pulse, so democrat governors signed orders to force nursing homes to take corona patients- people weren‚Äôt sent home to die.  If that did happen with terminal patients, then they went home on hospice....they had liquid morphine and ativan to make that last ride a breeze."
2020-10-06T13:03:56Z,And again: I repeat my earlier comments:<br>Get rid of this Man!<br>I miss words to describe his extreme attitude! I was living in Italy when the military transport with all the coffins were moving out of Bergamo! I saw when New York struggled with the Virus! <br>AND HE HAS THE GUTS TO TELL US &quot;DON&#39;T BE AFRAID OF THE VIRUS!&quot;<br>He - who had a team of at least 20 doctors and nurses who were around him 24/7 and still are! He who has access to every medication money can buy!<br>What did he learn in Hospital being ill? That power and money can buy you even health!<br>And still he does not care about others - again without mask!
2020-10-06T13:33:10Z,It is tax payer Dollars that pay for his Health care !
2020-10-06T13:34:59Z,You are such a loser.
2020-10-06T13:35:45Z,He has no clue what Americans are going through trying to save lives and trying to pay for treatments
2020-10-06T13:36:06Z,"Yeah he knows it is all bs and anyone smart enough to look at the real stats and compare this to real pandemics would know it is all bs , so sad to see so many people dumbed down so much"
2020-10-06T13:40:57Z,New York did not struggle whit this Virus. Trump send them a medical boat and they did not even use it. New York Killed ppl that was not sick with this virus. look it up
2020-10-06T13:03:53Z,He should just stay in the hospital i know he trying to stay strong but he dont got Notting to prove
2020-10-06T13:03:47Z,You heard the man.  COVID-19 is nothing to be afraid of.  MASKS OFF FOR TRUMP!
2020-10-06T13:21:47Z,"Andy Taylor Why not just throw us all in prison?  Wearing a mask is the exact same thing as losing our homes, property, and loved ones!"
2020-10-06T13:45:09Z,Andy Taylor I was agreeing with you.  Wearing a mask is as debilitating as being sent to prison.
2020-10-06T14:25:37Z,Andy Taylor &quot;Truth&quot; is as moldable as clay. Facts are immutable.
2020-10-06T14:50:29Z,Andy Taylor ...aaaaand Jesus has entered the chat.  Have a good rest of your day Mr. Taylor.  I hope you&#39;re able to enjoy a beautiful fall day like we&#39;re having here in Ohio.
2020-10-06T16:05:26Z,"Andy Taylor Not a darn thing.  I may be an atheist overall, but I still believe he was a real guy back in the day with valuable wisdom.  When he&#39;s invoked in a debate, though, I know to duck out gracefully."
2020-10-06T13:03:38Z,America has actually become so weak. Democrats have told us that vaccines won&#39;t work and then complain when Trump tries some therapeutics. We used to be a country that could do the impossible. Put men on the moon. Now we cower in fear and do as the media tells us to do. We&#39;ve done better than almost every single European country that everybody praises.
2020-10-06T13:03:32Z,"Why do you have others on the show when you won&#39;t let them report?  Joe, you are a scene hog.  You just ramble on."
2020-10-06T13:03:31Z,"I&#39;m European. In Europe, anyone covid19 positive, has to go through quarantine and cannot be out in the streets. Violators will be detained. Why? Because they will be spreading a deadly virus. What Trump did was the most irresponsible behavior.. specially because he is the President of USA and should be an example for the people. <br>Just a few days ago,  the president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, attended to a meeting in Portugal with The president of Portugal, Prime-Minister and other government personalities. One of them was tested positive and, immediately, all the people involved in this meeting were in quarantine and only after being tested negative twice, they went back to work. This meeting was under supervision of the Health Portuguese Authority (everyone using mask all the time and chairs were 3 meters apart.<br>The only person testing covid 19 positive is still in quarantine under doctors supervision and cannot leave the house no matter what.<br>This is Europe... and we know better. Be afraid Americans. Stay safe"
2020-10-06T13:03:27Z,"All the senators in the gop should go pay him a visit, give him a handshake, even giving him a hug, because they let him stay in power and enable him to the all the horrible things he has done so far. After all, Trump said not to be afraid."

2020-10-06T13:03:17Z,Trump trying to show machismo on the balcony while wheezing thru his teeth.  But what I see is a pitiful man.

2020-10-06T13:02:32Z,"Wow...I hope he wins a second term. He deserves it. He might not be the greatest president or the greatest guy but the way he has been treated since entering office is appalling. Nothing has come of all the witch hunts on him. The fact is he has done lots of good for this country, not saying it was all good but the fact remains. The man deserves another term imo, another term in peace and with actual support from both sides. When dems and republicans, lefts and rights, American citizen and American citizen became opponents trying to win against the other side..that&#39;s when democracy failed. We are all supposed to be on the same team, both sides fighting for the same goal, not their own goals."

Yes, you too can be ‚Äúimmune‚Äù to the COVID virus as long as you have access to excellent medical care provided by the federal government and paid for by US taxpayers. And this comes with no limits on coverage, no out of network, no co-pay, no denial of treatment options. Wait, that won‚Äôt work, that would be socialized medicine only available in commie, socialist countries."

2020-10-06T13:01:32Z,No he is not infected lies lies lies. He was having hard time breathing because he climbed all those stairs and is obese!!!!!

2020-10-06T13:01:18Z,Boris Johnson said Trump would stage a recovery. He certainly did! Another photo op! He is irresponsible and dangerous!
2020-10-06T13:01:15Z,I still say he‚Äôs faking.
2020-10-06T13:01:14Z,"When Trump says &quot;don&#39;t be afraid&quot; that really means &quot;run screaming in terror.&quot;  Trump lies - a lot - AND Trump lies a lot about EVERYTHING, especially COVID 19.<br><br>However, I cannot help to wonder what part or how much of Trump&#39;s getting COVID 19 was a PR stunt?  Trump is not an honest person and only does things that are in his interests; therefore, just how much of the dramatic flight , time spent at Walter Reed, and dramatic return - to a photo op unmasked and saluting the sunset was just PR to recover lost supporters?"
2020-10-06T13:25:16Z,"I think he just can&#39;t control the lies, he just lies for the sake of it. One of many traits of sociopathy."

2020-10-06T17:15:54Z,"Driss - sad but very true. Trump may check all the boxes for a sociopath, especially absolute disregard for human life.  What are his supporters seeing that we are not and why can his supporters not see the obvious things we see?"
2020-10-06T13:01:12Z,"His breathing looks really bad, if he had not been diagnosed as soon as he had I really think he would not have made it, at least he is loyal to the stockmarket because thats why he is obsessed with telling people to go back to business as usual"

I am climbing into my bunker.  On a serious note - I used to believe in objective jornalism but am glad that the media masks fell off after Trump&#39;s election and they revealed that they are political organizations - the type of political power, as Alexander Solzhenitsyn noted in his Harvard University commencement speech, that is not elected by anyone and not accountable to anyone."

2020-10-06T12:59:00Z,2 week isolation period for the virus. Trump: this won&#39;t effect me I&#39;ll just go and infect others.
2020-10-06T14:00:36Z,The two weeks is a precaution for those who may have the virus and may not yet be showing symptoms but are contagious. If you COVID but are improvement and no longer have a fever you may no longer be contagious. I would assume the doctors are able to test for the virus loading to see the levels and determine if he is still contagious. Your making an assumption. Not saying he is not contagious its just you I am not is primary Doctor nor have his resources so he maybe safe to return to the White House and they maybe taking additional precautions.
2020-10-06T14:21:36Z,Ironic that you say that when they traced it back to the debate that did not follow correct procedures. On top of that we all know very well you can spread it before you actually sick. You sound really f&#39;ing stupid right now LOL
2020-10-06T12:59:00Z,Truman is turning in his grave right now.

2020-10-06T12:57:42Z,"Tell that to the 210,000 Americans who died from the virus; and tell it to the 1,000,000 people who died worldwide from the virus. Trump was sent to the hospital to come out and proclaim the disease, which is ruining his chances at reelection, is nothing to be afraid of; he is again spreading disinformation. He didn&#39;t have a serious case because if he had he wouldn&#39;t have been released in a few days. I had it and lay in bed with a fever, not eating, weak for 21 days and I didn&#39;t develop the serious symptoms that required hospitalization. Trump had nothing and he should shut his stupid mouth."
2020-10-06T12:57:41Z,"Right!! Don‚Äôt be scared if you have every single medical thing at your fingertips to save your life which 99.999% of Americans don‚Äôt have.

2020-10-06T12:57:41Z,Trump controlling COVID-19 I wonder what the virus is thinking about that.
2020-10-06T12:57:39Z,Trump is correct at this point survival rate is at 99% this isnt about tribal politics there will be no future. I stood in food lines all spring. Get back to work! Everyone infected at the WH are reporting no issues. He couldn&#39;t breathe because he walked across the lawn with a mask restricting his breath happens to me too. Mask are disgusting people don&#39;t clean them they just keep putting them on again and again. First time in my life im voting R
2020-10-06T12:57:39Z,The Trump Virus ü¶† is now rampant in the WH!
2020-10-06T12:57:38Z,"did any of the reporters ask if the orange menace told those &quot;doctors&quot; what to say? did anyone ask who at the hospital released him, or did he release himself?"
2020-10-06T12:57:34Z,"This president put kids in cages, attempted to deport the &quot;Dreamers&quot;, threw gasoline on the growing racial unrest and intends to take healthcare away from millions during a pandemic. These are just a few of his greatest hits. On the pandemic front he mislead the American people about the seriousness of the coming virus and has done everything he can since to increase the severity of it. Now that he&#39;s succumbed to the &quot;hoax&quot; he is behaving in a way that endangers everyone around him while still pretending that it&#39;s nothing to be afraid of. With over 200,000 dead Americans on his watch he still wants us to ignore it and re-elect him. He is a narcissistic monster with no compassion for the rest of the population. Vote him out."

2020-10-06T12:57:00Z,"Trump is still on the steroids. They give you a huge false sense of superiority. If he‚Äôs smart, he‚Äôll hide from the public eye while he crashes. But the downturn from dexomethasone can last up to a month."

2020-10-06T12:56:54Z,Even if he was on a ventilator he would still say not to be afraid of the virus
2020-10-06T14:06:03Z,"Because that&#39;s what leaders do! Jesus said not to live in fear! Nothing wrong with living today boldly! The fake news chants every day &quot;we are all gonna die of COVID&quot; Just to clear that up, NO that is a lie. The 200K + deaths are NOT all COVID deaths, in fact MOST of the fatalities in that number were from other causes like heart attacks, car crashes, cancer etc.. that died WITH COVID, not FROM COVID. If you believe a mask is going to SAVE you then you are believing a lie. Even a properly fitted N-95 mask does NOT stop viruses 100%. Further more, if you are not wearing proper eye protection or have open sores, cuts or abrasions then the virus can easily enter your body. We are covered with viruses and bacteria and surrounded by it every second of every day. Live as healthy as you can, take your vitamins, because a Standard diet will leave you depleted of key nutrients. God bless you and all of your loved ones. God bless us all and help America once again lead the way to defeating something that was meant for evil schemes. God rebuke the CCP for the pain and misery it has unleashed on the globe."

2020-10-06T12:56:44Z,"The new Woodward tapes reveal that he was fully aware of the severity and transmissibility of the virus!  It is one thing to con people over material things, but it is another when it risks people&#39;s lives!  And the flu analogy is a false equivalence. The vaccine for flu is not completely effective because we encounter different strains each year.  Hopefully Covid won&#39;t mutate, so the vaccine will be effective, but if it does, a vaccine will still limit its impact.  And lets not forget the virus is far more transmissible than the flu!  The man cannot feel empathy and has no qualms about endangering Americans lives."

There are children that are going  may have to go into Foster Care because their parents both died. He&#39;s a con man who has gotten over on this country. His own sister said he&#39;s a clown and couldn&#39;t believe people would vote for someone that dumb. And why doesn&#39;t he and his privileged friends wear masks.

Basically threw up his middle finger to all of those who have suffered and died from COVID 19. The actions of this ‚Äúman‚Äù are unbelievable and irresponsible. I feel sorry for your healthcare workers who put their lives on the line everyday and he just mocks it...disgraceful. Words cannot describe this man. Along with everything else, this last photo op proves to the whole world he is unfit for office. What an A**<br>America, you‚Äôve been plunked for 4yrs...please wake up!!!"
2020-10-06T12:42:22Z,"Trump Has to Go!  Worst President ever!  Choose America!

2020-10-06T12:42:20Z,What a very bias twist on this story. Sad that our media tears down one side or the other. Not saying I support either side but think this is a bad look on the media.
2020-10-06T12:42:09Z,"Well this didn&#39;t work out as the dems wanted. Trump showed us this virus, and that&#39;s all it is, isn&#39;t the death sentence they want us to believe. Never was a need to shut country down and ruin the lives of so many people. Common sense was to protect the elderly and at risk, we all know how dem states handled that and what the outcome was.<br>Maybe now the mask wearing sheep out there , so easy to follow and obey, will wake up and see that they&#39;ve been duped.You&#39;ve been lied to since the start of this. Get back to work and back to living. Have you really enjoyed this tyranny you&#39;ve been under for many months now?<br>Stay Strong America<br>TRUMP 2020"
2020-10-06T12:42:09Z,"For the reporters and agents surfing the platforms , Trump&#39;s words reveal his secretive talks with doctors , when he said &quot;i can&#39;t be caged or locked up &quot; this was in reference to similar words spoken to doctors that pushed him through for an early release , from the hospital , the normal quarantine being 10 to 14 days ...PenDragon Art"

2020-10-06T12:41:47Z,"Knowingly spreading the deadly virus is a murderous crime.  IF Trump can do it and is not held accountable, anyone can do it and no criminal charge.  America is the killing field of the 21c."
2020-10-06T12:41:40Z,It is so ironic how much people hate Trump for the same qualities they exude. Just listening to this news report depicts how angry and hateful these reporters are. I hope you find peace in your hearts before you turn into even shittier people. Promoting division under the guise of equality and fairness... MSNBC you might just be incompetent.

2020-10-06T12:40:59Z,So much for self isolating or quarantining.

Anyway let him get better because i want the satisfaction of seeing soundly defeated at the polls.

2020-10-06T12:37:47Z,You are absolutely right. We will never know the whole truth because this administration is nothing but a reality show production using smoke and mirrors. Sad part is that there are Americans who would actually die for this president meanwhile there are Americans who have actually died because of this presidents miss handling of the pandemic.

2020-10-06T13:29:03Z,It makes him look more of a fool. That would be a dumb strategy. What possible benefit could any doctor have for going along with such a ridiculous lie. His career would be in tatters. Trump is a laughing stock throughout the world. He really has caught the disease which he said would be gone in the fall. He is only addressing those who believe these lies. Any seventy four year old who catches this virus is at risk of death but not until at least 10 days after the first contact with it. They didn&#39;t fill him with drugs in the last few days without good reason.

2020-10-06T12:31:44Z,Donald Trump Emergency treatment and 3 day private room stay with team of doctors at hospital with experimental treatments and any medication and the  cost 0$........( The best socialized medical care we can pay for.)  The rest of us get told to wait a few days to get test results then self isolate at home with no medical care. Then you can go to the  hospital when you can barely breath and are put in a shared room with 10 others or told we cant take you go somewhere else. When you do get into a hospital you share 1 doctor maybe 2 ( who have been working 21 hr days with 100 other patients. Hoping you don&#39;t die laying in a room listening to others die around you. Then you or your family gets a $73000+ bill.........Rigged capitalism gives the best health care out comes ( or so we are all told)

Worse, have 20,000+ lies and 4-years of brazen, in-our-faces deceptions from a lifelong-proven con man taught you so little that you can use to help save the lives of American citizens? Donald Trump might have been temporarily sidelined for obvious (or not) health reasons, but it&#39;s unlikely that he ever contracted COVID-19. Now the media is yet again playing directly into what appears to be his and the GOP&#39;s most catastrophic scam ever targeted on Americans. After all that Trump and this administration have so flagrantly, falsely cast upon us, it isn&#39;t too much to require reliable, verifiable evidence of what they&#39;re saying. Vigorously question the declarations of proven base-deceitfuls, rather than blindly accepting them as if they&#39;re ironclad true. They are not."

He will claim left and right that COVID-19 is no so lethal? He did the same when he was pushing the hydroxychloroquine. I&#39;m sorry but we are dealing with the biggest LIAR who as we know is in serious debt and he needs to win the re-election  in order to avoid the law, taxes,  possible bankruptcy and everything that he fears the most. Please America VOTE you deserve better otherwise  he will be pushing COVID-19 it&#39;s not lethal.  The American people has being deceived by this man time and time again.<br>Enough is Enough.

2020-10-06T12:25:27Z,Rarely do I watch such garbage but I have and now want to comment. Trump spoke of the progress that has been made medically since the beginning and what has been learned on treatment. Yes treatment protocols are vastly improved and effective.  This leader encourages people not to live daily with consuming fear regardless of what they hear from you guys. He does wear a mask when appropriate but not for PC folks and for the TV. Sorry about your hate and the tone of your lives each day must be nice to group hate anybody or anything like you losers.  By the way get used to it gonna last a while longer!

Taxpayers paid for him to have treatment way beyond his need which may not have been needed and which may actually harm him because it suppresses his own immune response to the virus. To say that 3 days in he is already testing negative again defies belief but that won&#39;t stop this narcissist from not wearing a mask and continuing his spread. I hope that VP Biden refuses to take the stage with him and asks to conduct his debate from a confined area so that he does not come in contact with this super spreader. I also hope that Biden now goes back on the attack about this governments handling on the virus, the costs in dollars and human lives and the fact that they held multiple indoor and outdoor events which contract tracing can prove were super spreader events even though he swore on stage during the debate that no one was getting sick. His own doctor confirmed he was positive Wednesday, 2 days before it was officially diagnosed when he said 72 hours. So his utter disregard of people added another million or two to the tally when you count how many people will be diagnosed and will need treatment."

One day, he flew into a rage over a limousine driver who arrived to pick him up wearing gray shoes, soiling his image by ‚Äúlooking like a f------ Puerto Rican.‚Äù <br>In 1988, shortly after I was promoted to president of Trump Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino, he invited me up to New York for lunch. There was a lot to talk over one issue in particular: one of our senior managers, who happened to be African-American. Donald considered him incompetent and wanted him fired. When I acknowledged some shortcomings in the man‚Äôs performance, he instantly became enthused. ‚ÄúYeah, I never liked the guy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd isn‚Äôt it funny, I‚Äôve got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it.¬†The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.‚Äù I was mortified. We were in a restaurant in Trump Tower. I worried he‚Äôd be overheard. But he went on,¬†‚ÄúBesides that, I‚Äôve got to tell you something else: I think the guy is lazy, and it‚Äôs probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is. I believe that. It‚Äôs not anything they can control.‚Äù <br>Trump is actually offended that anyone would even suggest that he&#39;s NOT a racist. Notice how he never seems to be offended by being called a racist. Whenever he makes racist comments, he doesn&#39;t take them back, he doubles down on them. Trump&#39;s racist comments over the years have received praise from neo-nazis and white supremacist leaders like David Duke. Trump: &quot;Jeb Bush has to like the Mexican illegals because of his wife.&quot; Jeb Bush‚Äôs wife is Mexican - American During the campaign, Trump impugned the character of U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, a native-born American, hailing from Indiana, who was hearing a class action case against Trump&#39;s now-discredited fake Trump University. &quot;He&#39;s a Mexican,&quot; Trump said to CNN of Curiel. &quot;We&#39;re building a wall between here and Mexico. The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings ‚Äî rulings that people can&#39;t even believe.&quot; Claiming a person can&#39;t do their job because of their race is sort of like the¬†textbook definition of a racist comment.
