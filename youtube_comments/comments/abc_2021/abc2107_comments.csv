2021-07-30T22:47:30Z,&quot;President Trump quietly got his vaccine before leaving office but rarely urges his supporters to get theirs...&quot;  I&#39;m curious on what social platform you think he should do this on.  His Twitter account or his FB account?

2021-07-25T21:47:45Z,I guess Biden can&#39;t go on telling us that vaccinated can&#39;t catch this. Well...actually he could...and people might still believe it. But the takeaway from this should be that everyone is equal when it comes to the virus vaccinated or not. We can all catch it and just as equally spread it. So save yourselves.
2021-07-25T21:32:45Z,Mr biden should close up the schools!!! The cases will show when schools starts

2021-07-22T14:59:51Z,"Is anyone still even remotely scared about Covid? The media won&#39;t stop beating this dead horse of a topic. It was the world&#39;s most over-reaction for a mild, nothing virus that 99% of the people that caught it... never even knew they had it... until they were told by a random test. <br>I believe Covid &#39;could be a problemn&#39;, like every other ailment... if you already are in poor health, or are very old, et cetera. But for any otherwise healthy person under 50... there&#39;s was virtually a 0% chance of having major complications or dying from it. ZERO PERCENT! And now it&#39;s basically controlled... and is not 1% the danger it was last year.... But the media still just revels in hyping this to try to scare the few impressionable and suggestable dopes they can get."

No we had with wonderful advise from the ignorant right. They discouraged us from getting vaccinated because it wasn‚Äôt totally FDA approved. I went ahead and got vaccinated. Even if it doesn‚Äôt prevent an infection, you do get a less virulent case and don‚Äôt end up in the hospital. So glad we didn‚Äôt have these modern day idiots discouraging us from the Polio vaccine."

That&#39;s BS he talked about the vaccines for months and months and months it was Kamala that first said she did not trust the vaccine and might not get it Trump never said that you fool! It was you leftist media question the vaccine and against it now nobody else can and force it upon people like dictator because Joe Biden get in office and fraud went through. Trump never said don&#39;t trust the vaccine or that he was not going to get it but Kamala did but you won&#39;t say that huh? It was you all questioning and going after the vaccines at first now you do a total 180 because Joe Biden in office and fraud went through. Trump just said hes not going to be a dictator and &#39;force&#39; people to get it but now you want to be a dictator with it and trying to force people. Even on extreme leftist shows Ivanka went on a national leftist tv show and they were questioning it and acting against it. Trump was literally pushing the vaccine for months telling us they are coming soon and that it is good while Kamala was talking against it. Now the dictators say no one can say anything against vaccines like Kamala did and free speech gone dictators say.

Turns out that pandemics have learning curves. The CDC updates its websites and information about known side effects are given out along with the vaccine.  The main issue I have with the CDC is lack of data science in tracking COVID.  Originally the CDC was not even tracking COVID numbers male vs female.  Now, the CDC has stopped tracking breakthrough cases of vaccinated people in the US.  We are once again having to look to Israel for statistics because they choose to track every detail of COVID related information."

Going to third world countries because it was cheaper, hey, but people there haven‚Äôt been vaccinated.  It‚Äôs OK to bring in variants that way.  It‚Äôs OK to have open borders where people test positive but are put on a bus or plane and sent all over the country.  I had Covid and I respect it for what it is.  The weirdest virus I have ever had and a year later I continue to take supplements, wash my hands, don‚Äôt touch my face, stay away from people that are actively coughing.  It is possibly a man-made RNA virus that only knows one thing, replicate and find a host and everything a virus usually does, this one doesn‚Äôt.  We will continue to get variants because RNA viruses are highly unstable."

2021-07-21T07:33:12Z,"@PenitentDeadMan308 T can&#39;t have a better life when you can&#39;t even have a stable economy because of the virus continuing to spread through the masses of immigrants that are not even quarantined when they have a virus before being released. Have you not seen how they have immigrants packed like sardines at the holding centers? They get released next day because they claim to be families(many are, and many are traffickers) but they aren&#39;t even quarantined before release when they have Covid! How are we stopping the spread if they don&#39;t control the amount of people coming in contact with infected individuals and being released to the rest of population? We can barely take care of our homeless and give them decent lives, how are we gonna be able to give these people decent and healthy lives? If the government doesn&#39;t even protect it&#39;s own citizens, what makes you think they will care about the immigrants? They don&#39;t,  they just want a serf class to take advantage of."

2021-07-21T06:20:22Z,"The World has to be united to face the Universal Challenge of defeating the Pandemic and to ignite a new fully Non-Violent Revolution of transformation of the Defense System that is based on Non-Lethal Weaponry System in the Earth . Nobody needs to die in the wars from now . Actually the weapon could bring pleasures in the targetted Human Beings like drinking the Bhang-Drinks during Holi-Festivals that is known to the Vice-President . America has to lead the Humankind in this new revolution of our species . Dollar-Hungry King Mahendra Shah&#39;s introduction of the Beef-Menu at the Soaltee Hotel in Kathmandu resulted into the decay of the identity and the image of the only Hindu Nation on the Earth when he was above any constitution or any law of the country or Verdicts of the Supreme Court of Nepal and ruled the country by himself . King Birendra Shah&#39;s special love of the insurgent Maoists hindered the use of the then Royal Nepal Army to crush the Maoist insurgency when the dead were less than a dozen and it resulted into the loss of more than 17,000 Nepalese . Nepal Government in Singhadarbar failed to be concerned about the need to protect the life and property of the citizens while bribery was breeding very fast and being institutionalized under its cover and protection . All of the Prime Ministers in Singhadurbar during the Maoist Insurgency shall pay for the loss of more than 17,000 Nepalese in the most horrific war inside their own country . During an Interview with Ekata TV on 10 th July , 2021 , Political Analyst Dr. Vijay Mishra has charged that Ex-King Gyanendra Shah had donated Rs. 60,000/- to start Maoist Insurgency . If the charges by Dr. Mishra is not true , Ex-King Gyanendra Shah needs to tell the people that the charges are baseless . Ex-King Gyanendra Shah demolished the foundation of the Hindu Nation and the image of the Hindu Throne in the World by legalizing abortion . The Anti-Hindu politics of the Kumbh-Mela is a dishonor to every Hindu in the World . Nepal shall be recognized as the Zone of Peace by India and China that would benefit both countries and the Whole World as well . It would end India&#39;s worries of the Chinese advances via Nepal . The country of the Birth of the Light of Asia must not be converted into the Hell of the Darkness of Violence and War in Asia . Nepal needs to give birth to a fully new constitution that shall live forever , restore sovereignty , eradicate bribery and guarantee justice to every citizen of Nepal . The election is the safest way to achieve this need .The latest constitution died longtime ago and it needs to be cremated with very jubilant celebrations all over the country before the maggots eat up everything with nothing left . Any decision by the judiciary of Nepal by stepping on the constitution that is already dead and smelly , against the dissolution of the Parliament would be meaningless . Angikrit-Nagriktawala Buharis and Joinarans with their parents having the IDs of the Foreign countries shall never have voting rights and their kids born in Nepal shall have full rights including the right to vote . The Monarchists were voted by 0.77 % of the Nepalese in the last election . They would need to make an outstanding jump to form their government after the coming election . If they are able to do so , their government can surely conduct the national referendum for the restoration of the monarchy . Nepal Army shall not go into the adventure of any coup as a response to the SOS-Call by certain Academicians that are inclined to dance in the streets of Kathmandu according to the music in Delhi . It certainly shall not agree to the orders from Delhi via Baluwatar if such designs were communicated to then Prime Minister Oli in the middle of the night by Samanta Goel of Indian Intelligence Agency (RA) . Ex-King Gyanendra Shah needs to self-exile to a country of his own choice with every member of his descendants if he is induced to implicate in a design that would repeat the history of his coronation when he was 3 years old . Those that violated the Directives of King Prithvinarayan Shah can not fulfill his desires to rejuvenate our country as a pure and genuine Hindu Nation in the World . Ex-King Gyanendra Shah&#39;s legalization of abortion can not be pardoned by any Hindu . Nepal shall be the Capital of the Hindu World like Mecca for the Moslems . No Prime Minister of Nepal shall undermine the Directives of Prithvinarayan Shah pertaining to the necessity of following Non-Aligned Foreign Policy if he is honest to protect the sovereignty of our country . His Oath of Office at the Rastrapati-Bhavan Sheetal Niwas needs to be respected by him . King Prithvinarayan Shah did not wear any Western-Coat and Bhadgaunle-Topi . Do the ministers of the Federal Republic of Nepal want to exhibit their funny show that King Prithvinarayan Shah was less Nationalist than them ?

COVID is allowed to mutate and become much more contagious and drastically reduce the effectiveness of the COVID vaccines. We should really start criminalize these far right superspreading killers.

Since we know the survival rate of this virus with no lasting side effects is about 98.98% for average healthy person under 70 and most of them don&#39;t require any treatment and only have very mild cases...

Then you have the little Marxist  weasel of an AOC that lied to the American people saying she was in the building and scared that the people were coming for her when the so called insurrection occurred on the 6th. The AOC wasn&#39;t even in the building on the 6th. She said it purposely to make Trump look like he was responsible for inciting violence at the Capital that particular day when he was giving a speech miles away. Just like Pelosi didn&#39;t have the dignity,integrity or foresight to have the building secure on the 6th of January. Same thing with her. It was done on purpose to try to get Trump impeached for a second time for inciting a riot on that day. In case you missed it Pelosi had the place surrounded by fences and barbed wire with National Guard Troops after Biden took office."

A Rushed Experimental vaccine..ljust vaccinate for the sake of vaccinating? Remember the vaccines are still listed as emergency use and there&#39;s no liability on behalf of the pharmaceutical companies..... A vaccine for a disease or virus with a 98.90% survival rate for most average healthy people with no lasting effects.... I&#39;m all for vaccines that are put through vigorous and lengthy testing.... Before the vaccine people were treated with therapeutic plasma harvested from those that had covid and recovered ... That seems a far far better and safer solution for a disease with such a high survival rate and only a fractional percentage that do get it require hospitalization...Trump pushed this through  WAY Too fast... Roughly 500,000 people are said to have died with covid in 2020 in the United States... The CDC said minimally over 100 million people got the virus and recovered without a vaccine.... This Fanatical pushing and pushing of this experimental vaccine makes less sense as time goes by.... A population of 350 million and 500,000 died last year in the US.... I&#39;ve had relatives and Friends from literally coast to coast and in between that got covid-19 and are 100% fine....Only 1 got very sick and was hospitalized...She has a life long history of  lung issues, overweight ,high blood pressure, and had open heart surgery in 2018..., COVID-19 almost killed her..she got released after 10 days in hospital... It took her 2and a half months at home to Fully recover.. thankfully she&#39;s 100% fine no lasting effects.she was one of the first early cases in 2020."

2021-07-21T02:23:37Z,Well I say some are doomed. Say get a shot well just think. I&#39;m sure some people have no health insurance. They either can&#39;t get state insurance because they are probably over there limit or they cant afford health market insurance. Because they don&#39;t make enough. So my guess is some are not getting the vaccines because if they have a reaction they can&#39;t afford the medical bill that would follow if they had to go to the hospital. I think if it&#39;s requested that all people should get it then for the sake of the ones that aren&#39;t getting it because they can&#39;t afford it.  Then the government  should offer to pay there medical Bill&#39;s or give them insurance so they can see doctors if they were to become sick. Just saying I think it&#39;s only fair shall I say. But if a person has recently had there first case of Covid then I think there good and shouldn&#39;t have to have a vaccine just thinking. Will just say I&#39;m over all this and I wish for a normal again but that is probably never going to happen again.

I work in the medical field and some of them are not getting the vaccine due to there own personal reasons but I know some don&#39;t have health insurance. This is just from talks today with one and they say the relief wouldnt be able to cover all the way. If something was to go bad on them and then when there doing some what better and end up a long holler if that was to happen. But they had Covid about a month ago. And are on a 90 day period before they can get tested again. But they hadn&#39;t gotten Covid when basically the entire staff are work at it along with patients. They worked through the entire last year and were fine until just recent. But I&#39;m thinking maybe they had were they could have been a carrier and not know. And now an entire year later they officially have there turn to get sick. But I know some states are helping some others you have to reach a guide line for it.

My question would be why is there a 90 day waiting period?  Is it because of testing site availability because where I live testing is available not only in hospitals, clinics, labs, employers, but in drive-up and walk-up sites in neighborhoods. There is not a zip code in our metro area that does not have free COVID testing available daily with no restrictions. Rapid COVID testing gives same day results. Swabs give 3-5 day results. Please google or internet search for free COVID testing in your area?"
2021-07-21T03:51:29Z,@@mtaylor7307 90 days she cant get tested again. Because it will say or so my state says. For 90 days it is dormant shall I put it. Will always read positive until the 90day window is over and she can resume. Testings but for a Covid shot she has to look it up for requirements after 90 days.

We have got to start nurturing and supporting and electing better candidates.  Politicians have forgotten their oath of office to serve.

2021-07-21T21:20:46Z,@@captainamerica9028 can‚Äôt trust anybody to tell us the truth.
2021-07-21T00:55:58Z,Look at Biden with no mask on at all
2021-07-21T00:55:53Z,I thought they are vaccinated
2021-07-21T01:13:21Z,"Getting vaccinated reduces the risk of contracting covid but does not stop it completely. The important part is that if you do get covid having been vaccinated, you are much much less likely to have severe disease resulting in hospitalization. It also means  shorter duration and less symptoms so less chance of transmitting the disease."
2021-07-21T01:25:14Z,@@sillybugMaryam which means the vaccinated are mostly the asymptomatic super spreaders lol. Good job team.
2021-07-21T01:28:33Z,@@JennySimon206 LoL nope. Vaccinated humans can get from another person but won&#39;t be extreme enough to be taken to the hospital.
2021-07-21T01:32:15Z,"@@JennySimon206 Thats one of the reasons that Herd immunity is so important. Vaccinated persons are way less at risk of getting covid but if the get it yes they can be asymptomatic. If we have a large percentage of vaccinated persons, the virus has much less chance of infecting people and spreading further because of of those persons will have an increased ability to fight it off.  You would also note that we encourage people who got vaccinated to still take precautions so that they do not get themselves infected or spread to others. When there is herd immunity it will be much better. We&#39;ve seen this through our history. Remember that viruses cannot survive long without a living host so the more people who can fight it off and not give it new home, the better."
2021-07-21T01:47:46Z,@counselthyself Hence the reason we are all trying to reduce the prevalence while also increasing vaccination.
2021-07-21T00:55:44Z,It‚Äôs contradicting itself. Your saying they were vaccinated but still got the covid. But then your saying still get shots.
2021-07-21T01:01:52Z,People can still catch Covid even though they get the vaccine but allegedly they won‚Äôt have severe symptoms
2021-07-21T01:22:46Z,@@shantelgoggins9222 Allegedly they weren‚Äôt supposed to get COVID‚Ä¶ yet here we are.
2021-07-21T01:26:04Z,@@shantelgoggins9222 which makes them asymptomatic super spreaders
2021-07-21T04:00:49Z,UK gov website says 40% of people hospitalized with Covid are fully vaccinated.
