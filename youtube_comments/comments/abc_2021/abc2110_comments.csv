China&#39;s strict measures has led to China&#39;s low death rate.<br>Covid deaths = USA 1,174,631   Mexico 334,336   UK 228,924   Canada 53,419   Australia 22,687   China 5,272   New Zealand 4,775.<br>Did Covid come from Fort Detrick? During July 2019 nearby US Green springs rest home started having Covid deaths."

2021-10-26T02:21:51Z,LOVE YOU BRITT CLENNETT! : ) Happy to see you home &lt;3
2021-10-25T19:32:23Z,Take back your gun&#39;s.
2021-10-28T10:23:40Z,Why?
2021-10-25T04:01:36Z,Why would you go to this prison camp?
2021-10-28T10:28:01Z,You have been watching fox too much. Most states and maskless and living a free life going to the theatre and beach.
2021-10-28T13:00:45Z,"@@mkely9032 and the unvaccinated? Now they’re no longer your countrymen? I don’t watch Fox. I watch all news and form my own opinion since they’re all biased including ABC. Only a fool watches something and doesn’t fact check in today’s day and age. And the laws being passed there are tyrannical no matter how you slice it. The way people were treated having their civil liberties stripped. Interstate travel suspended etc. Is tyrannical. If you like that, you may have issues."
2021-10-25T01:05:34Z,Could a private airline decide on it&#39;s own to only serve specific customers (which could be done by placing a cap or limiting the # of flyers per day)? Or is that not possible as a privately owned business?
2021-10-24T03:40:39Z,Hitler&#39;s dictatorship is alive and well
2021-10-23T01:36:57Z,"Yeah, I’m sure she’s so happy to be there 🙄"
2021-10-23T01:37:44Z,Trying to make US citizens ok with “community isolation camps”.
2021-10-28T10:26:14Z,"@@1210starshine That is right, go spread the virus instead."
2021-10-28T12:22:39Z,"@@mkely9032 I’m not denying that there’s a virus, but you’re really ok with just giving up your freedom like that? It starts with small things before getting to the big things , like mandating a lockdown, then you must wear masks, then you must get a vaccine which by the way doesn’t prevent you from catching nor spreading said virus..."
2021-10-22T05:23:59Z,This need to stop new
2021-10-22T05:23:36Z,Way  I&#39;m in this programs any way?

2021-10-22T03:44:31Z,"Interesting,  interviewed while cooped up in a hotel facility? Do the new arrivals to there have to quarantine ?  From ABC news. Peter Jennings would have covered this betterhuh. Where was her family?  Why didn’t she show the triumphant re unification ? Hazmat and quarantine awaits you after spending all yourhuh money to get there."
2021-10-22T03:02:50Z,ABC has no true journalists
2021-10-22T08:18:27Z,They have entertainment sales representatives. This so called journalist doesn’t highlight the tyrannical behavior in Australia’s leaders. No mention the camps are permanent. Deployed counter terrorist forces on its own people. Yeah “cruel”? How about evil!
2021-10-22T00:52:48Z,Welcome home Brit. You know you are safe and sound at home now. Good on ya mate.
2021-10-21T22:47:24Z,⭐️🇺🇸🦅TRUMP2020🦅🇺🇸⭐️

2021-10-21T22:40:00Z,That’s like an escaped North Korean choosing to go back home
2021-10-21T22:35:27Z,Australia has become tyrannical. <br>America isn&#39;t far behind. 💯
