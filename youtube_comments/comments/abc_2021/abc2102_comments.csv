2021-02-25T03:20:40Z,CORONA=66 6 letters in CORONA.<br>The jab=the MaRk!!! Count the number like the Bible tells us.<br>Revelation 13:18kjv<br>18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.

2021-02-24T18:43:32Z,Anyone who died in the hospital for any reason is blamed on covid19 so the numbers are wrong.

2021-02-23T20:49:23Z,"Biden: &quot;The people we lost were extraordinary. They spanned generations. Born in America, immigrated to America, but just like so many of them, took their final breath alone in America. As a nation we can&#39;t accept such a cruel fate.<br><br>Trump: &quot;It is what it is.&quot;"

2021-02-23T06:01:00Z,My daddy died a month ago. He was the kindest man a friend to all. He and my mother foster kids with special needs for 30 years. Having numerous kids through their home. I am so sad that covid took my daddy. We watched through a window while he took his last breathe. I begged for my mother to be able to hold his hand while he slipped away but we were denied that. That was the hardest part.
2021-02-23T05:32:28Z,This is so sad 😞
2021-02-23T04:33:00Z,"Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: “The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.<br>Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others.<br>“But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted&quot;.<br><br>You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.<br><br>If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.<br><br>And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.<br><br>This, then, is how you should pray:<br><br>Our Father in heaven,<br>hallowed be your name,<br>your kingdom come,<br>your will be done,<br>on earth as it is in heaven.<br>Give us today our daily bread.<br>And forgive us our debts,<br>as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br>And lead us not into temptation,<br>but deliver us from the evil one.<br><br>For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.<br><br>&quot;Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway&quot;, we can use google search.<br>These are the teachings,<br>The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.<br>REPENT, and start doing what is right.<br>If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.<br><br>A time is coming and has now come, that the true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and Truth. God is Spirit, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and Truth; they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.<br><br>In the New Heaven and New Earth,<br>only Righteousness dwells.<br>May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all."

2021-02-23T03:25:46Z,"&quot;Remembering the lives lost to COVID-19&quot; motivates us, the people of America, to redouble our efforts to rapidly find out at any given moment, including even while On-Line, who among us are unwittingly contagious (i.e. pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic) in order to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23convinceitforward"">#ConvinceItForward</a> for them to call their doctor and to self-quarantine per CDC guidelines in hopes of stopping this pandemic instead of having more <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mourninginamerica"">#MourningInAmerica</a>.

2021-02-23T01:55:43Z,"Finally we have a chance to remember each of Covid victims. So many lives, so many stories. It&#39;s so heartbreaking to watch it. 500,000 people amount to the population of a city in the US such as Tuscon  AZ or Fresno, CA. It is just so tragic."

2021-02-23T16:13:47Z,@@stanleykelley8191 did you know that the pcr test has a 90% false positive? So how many thousands of thousands died from something else than covid?

2021-02-23T01:42:45Z,"I really do have to say that this should be a wake-up call to so many Americans out there tonight that haven&#39;t been taking the pandemic seriously enough right up to this point.  And that&#39;s because they have been way too damn busy out there partying hard, making attempts to get other people sick with the Coronavirus, treating the deadly disease like it&#39;s a game or something, etc.  And as of tonight, I would like to say that all of that foolishness right there just needs to end TONIGHT AND all of those parties and all of those major weddings will just have to wait until this fall when social distancing will be just COMPLETELY a thing of the past and everyone will become able to be close to one another AT LAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  OK?  I shall remind everyone out there that the Coronavirus is seriously real and it&#39;s STILL out there right up in the air.  Alright?  And with that being said, I expect all of those total circus clowns out there to quit acting like they just don&#39;t care about the Coronavirus AND each and every single person that still has it right at this moment and start ACTUALLY caring about them and the deadly disease itself.  This ain&#39;t a joke.  This ain&#39;t a hoax.  And we all know damn well that it ain&#39;t a scam or something ridiculous like that.  Again, this is REAL and it&#39;s still out there.<br><br>And therefore, with all of that in mind this evening, from now on, if any of those leftover anti-COVID snowflakes out there really wanna keep on denying the existence of the Coronavirus and also keep on refusing to wear a damn mask before heading outside for just anything, well, instead of reminding all of those triggered COVIDiots the importance of their health and safety during the rest of the pandemic, ummmmm, we will just have no other choice but to just let them die in vain because of course all of those morons oughta know that they&#39;re gonna be the sorry ones here when they get the Coronavirus and then just maybe die peacefully from the deadly virus.  And yes, all of their friends and families will cry hard over losing them to the Coronavirus without a doubt.  So with that in mind, either it&#39;s mask up or die for those ultra soft snowflakes out there from this very point on going forward.  And as for the rest of us, well, we&#39;re just good to go because we sure do have way much more common sense than all of those boneheads out there."
2021-02-23T01:32:14Z,R.I.P to Everyone who died <br>During this I hope everyone will get through this Pandemic 🕊🥺💀

This is what happens when you have a surrender mon.key posing as a tough guy.<br><br>In the midst of a national health crisis, when America needed a leader the most, Trump failed. It was a catastrophic failure with lethal consequences. we were cursed with a narcissistic sociopath who cared more about the stock market, playing golf, lining his own pockets, and getting reelected, than he did about the American lives he swore an oath to defend and protect. <br><br>Trump’s lies and downplaying of the pandemic will be remembered as the greatest dereliction of duty in presidential history.

2021-02-23T01:48:06Z,Is it the died with numbers or the from numbers that I&#39;m blaming  the covid variant china on orange man rad just curious cdc web site changed bout a month an a half ago now I think the cuomo numbers don&#39;t have to be added or were added just the math was off by how many he killed
2021-02-23T02:06:21Z,"I agree. Trump did nothing but let it happen and thought this would work for his re election. Well it failed and led to him losing. Say what you want about Joe Biden, but at least he is taking this seriously and wants our country and the world to end this pandemic. We&#39;re in this together."

2021-02-23T12:30:35Z,I think most  people don&#39;t die from covid but die from pre existent condition along with covid it&#39;s like getting stabbed by a knife and you bleed to death do you die from getting stab or from massive blood loss

2021-02-23T14:29:27Z,"It&#39;s not that covid-19 is fake, it&#39;s the fact that people are using this for power grabs, control, money, corruption, fraudulent votes, and there indeed has been false covid-19 reported deaths. I personally know someone that died in a car accident and the reason for death listed on the paperwork said covid. The family threatened legal action and the hospital changed it back. So hospitals are using this as a covid income for more funding, politicians are using the covid stimulus bills to launder money into programs and institutions that their family runs (non-covid related). So when you have politically charged fake reporting continuously, that is what people mean about it being fake. The true numbers are much lower and it has turned into a corrupt political money grab by our politicians to gain power, wealth and control. Wake up people!! Prayers for all that have been lost."
