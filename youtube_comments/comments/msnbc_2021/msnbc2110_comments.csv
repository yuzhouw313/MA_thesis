2022-01-24T20:39:48Z,"Exit polls during the last election showed that , when asked &quot;What was the No. 1 issue for you in this recall election?&quot;, 2 out of 3 respondents said Newsom&#39;s response to COVID.   Anti-vaxers keep claiming hat they won&#39;t take the vaccine because it&#39;s not like &quot;normal vaccines where you are immune from the disease for lige ... OK, name them.<br><br>Smallpox is the only prominent disease that  &quot;effectively&quot; provides lifetime protection as it used a live &quot;cowpox&quot; virus.  It doesn&#39;t seriously affect humans but it provides immunity to other &quot;pox&quot; viruses. The antivaxers come back with polio and a sling of others ....&quot;effectively&quot; destroying their own argument.  Some facts for the &quot;everything we know&quot; crowd.<br><br>Typhoid - This vaccine does not provide lifetime protection.   Antibodies remain in your system for to to 5 years.    The reason it is almost unheard of in the US is that EVERYBODY got the vaccine.  Of course this is the disease for which everyone has heard of &quot;Typhoid Mary&quot;.  The ONLY reason that typhoid is virtually unheard of in he United States is because we didn&#39;t have 30% of the population walking around every day as virtual Typhoid Matts and Marys as we do with COVID. In order for a disease to be transmitted, it needs to have been incubated in a live host.   If everyone has been vaccinated, then no live hosts to transmit it to everyone else, it&#39;s virtually &quot;extinct&quot;.  If everyone in the US was vaccinated against COVID, and Trumpublicans would stop trading lives for campaign funds, it would be gone ...no COVID virus incubators walking around = 0% chance of transmission.  Today, over 400 Americans get typhoid very year, when traveling to other countries (South Asia, especially India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh, etc) where significant segments of the population have not been vaccinated.  The Typhoid vaccine is only effective for 2 - 5 years.  Mary was a super-spreader extraordinairre ... a cook who admitted she never washed her hands because &quot;she didn&#39;t believe in germs&quot;.  She was finally quarantined on and island and is credited with over 50 deaths.<br><br>Polio / Diphtheria - This vaccine does NOT provide guaranteed lifetime protection.   Like almost every vaccine, the protection lasts for a set period of time. This disease has also been virtually eliminated in the US so if weren&#39;t vaccinated as a child, your exposure risk is virtually nil because your chances of encountering a carrier is extremely low.  However if traveling abroad, adults are advised to consult their physician and ,if destination proves a risk, get additional shots (depending on how many you got as a child) and a booster.  If you travel to a country that has people walking around with polio, you need to be vaccinated before you go there.<br><br>Tetanus -  This vaccine does not provide lifetime protection(estimated at 10 years) .  In the United States, where regular shots are given for tetanus, this disease has been almost eliminated. As per CDC reports, a meager 233 cases of tetanus infections were reported in the U.S. between the years 2001 and 2008, and largely *due to people being late with their booster shots*.<br><br>Rabies - The disease persists in wild animals. However, it has been eradicated among humans and also from domestic animals in the U.S. through regular vaccine shots.   The rabies vaccine is effective for a period of between 3 and 5 years.<br><br>Yellow fever - Although it has been eradicated in the U.S., cases of yellow fever still occur in other parts of the world, like Africa and South America. Stay home where&#39;s there no disease incubators on the elevator with you and your fine .... go some place where the vaccination never reached saturation point and you have people effectively making sure it stays around and gets passed from generation to generation.  For persons who may be ex[posed to the virus, a booster is recommended avery 10 years.<br><br>HiB - Like COVID, treatment exists for this disease. Even still the death rate for children is about 5% if infected. The vaccine was released in 1985, since then, the disease , after 36 years, still has not eliminated from the U.S.<br><br>Rinderpest  -  Nice pairing herewith HiB.   This disease affects cattle and other animals.  The vaccine was developed in 1994 and the last case was reported in 2001.   Just 7 years ... why so fast ?  The cows didn&#39;t refuse their farmer&#39;s mandate and now they are not dying ... at least till they hit the slaughterhouse.   Odd how humans will risk their life but not risk getting hit in their wallet.<br><br>Whooping Cough - Natural immunity is estimated to last 4 - 20 years and vaccine immunity 4 - 12 years.<br><br>*Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) - When the U.S. was hit with a record-breaking 667 measles cases in 27 states in 2014, the majority of people who got sick were unvaccinated.   If you were vaccinated before 1968, you&#39;ll want to get revaccinated. This is because early vaccines used an inactive, rather than a live, virus. &quot;This recommendation is intended to protect those who may have received killed measles vaccine, which was available in 1963-1967 and was not effective.<br><br>Mumps outbreaks are very rare, but do occur particularly in settings where people have close, prolonged contact, such as universities, schools, and correctional facilities.  People who come in contact with infected persons or part of such a group are advised to be revaccinated."

No sympathy needed and no F&#39;s given anymore so if you have food on your table, if you have toilet paper in your bathroom, if you have a mask to wear on your face: thank me and many like me, who went to work everyday when COVID struck, and some have had Covid twice and others didn&#39;t survive it. YOU ARE WELCOME, I showed up, &quot;no vac&#39;ers&quot;, like moi,  have been on the frontline since day 1. Now we are threatened with being fired and our companies are threatened with government control.  F that.  Those of you who took COVID shots that was entirely your choice but you make my point, you&#39;re willing to take a shot of  chemicals with no regard that it&#39;s not been trial tested long enough, and that you have to have boosters. Did the mighty Dr. Fauci say that up front?  NO. No he did not.  He lies so easily. One of the three original Covid shots caused deaths by blood clots and they stopped giving it, did you know that? Right now, there is NO covid vaccine, no more than there is a flu vaccine. You are being used as lab monkies.  I  have zero problem with sound public health policy that is backed by science and actual lab testing.  I was a child of the 60s given 12 shots to get into PRIVATE school, no problem. Anyway, I have been out here since day 1 of Covid and have lost co workers and friends to Covid while we worked through Covid. Now blind sheep are telling me what is right for me but should mind their own business, shut the F up, stop telling me you know what is going on. I don&#39;t wish Covid on my worst enemy. Those who are pro-mandate for Covid SHOTS and boosters, and whatever else the CDC comes up with, you pro-Vac&#39;ers should STFU because the US Government is lying to you again. If you want to really have information listen to fellow Americans, like me, who are telling you there is NO VACCINE, not at the present moment. And I REFUSE to take anything."

2021-10-01T21:15:23Z,"@@nigelstanford4‚Ä¶ I live in a red state. I also work in a school. I‚Äôve also witnessed children dying, one or both parents dying because they refused the vaccine and refused to wear masks. So WTF are you talking about?!"

2021-10-02T00:31:25Z,Thank him for what? I&#39;ve lived in California all 30 years of my life. All the liberals running this state for years and years haven&#39;t made anything better. Why push a vaccine on children when children are highly unlikely to even get sick from it? Oh yeah I forget you people are stupid and like to be used and make people money through how stupid you are. Lining their pockets with those buying the stocks of these pharmaceutical companies and helping them maintain power. How easily manipulated humans are.

2021-10-01T20:09:53Z,Mandating a vaccine to children who have less than a .25% chance of dying from covid?  Are we really going to allow the government to inject a treatment into our children without any real clue what the long term effects could be?
2021-10-01T20:09:51Z,So where‚Äôs the science in border patrol agents have to get vaccinated or lose their jobs. <br>But illegals can cross without being vaccinated and given the choice to get vaccinated if they want ?
2021-10-01T20:09:46Z,I asked my doctor when Covid will no longer be a threat and he said &quot;I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not a politician. &quot;

2021-10-01T20:05:01Z,Anyone old enough to remember the introduction of the polio vaccines have no trouble believing in the effectiveness of vaccines.  They also have no trouble believing that the world is a globe..
2021-10-01T20:25:28Z,I&#39;m old enough as well to remember the polio vaccines when they started. I also know people who had a mild case of polio as a child but recovered. As they grew older their &quot;mild&quot; case turned into COPD and they are not smokers however they are impacted as if they have emphysema. Trouble breathing sometimes and body muscle loss. People are worried about the impact of the vaccine in ten years? I&#39;m more concerned about my friends who have had covid and its impact on their bodies in ten years.
2021-10-01T20:04:13Z,Except for Gavin‚Äôs kids.
2021-10-01T20:14:58Z,Great to see you republicans so DESPERATE. republican party is DEAD (literally)
