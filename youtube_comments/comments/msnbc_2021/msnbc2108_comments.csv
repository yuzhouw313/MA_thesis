2022-05-03T13:49:36Z,It&#39;s kinda funny to look back on all the lies of MSNBC and all the people who believe them. Alot of ignorant people in the world. Step one of being informed...Don&#39;t watch Bill Gates and Pfizer sponsored news...
2022-03-01T20:39:01Z,"And yet Florida and other states love Desantis and even want him to run for president. So, MSNBC must be lying again."
2022-02-27T20:04:18Z,Attention. People be aware.  COVID-19 Data Misrepresented by Florida Governor.  Governor DeSantis has  skewed the rate to justify reopening schools and businesses.
2022-01-31T19:44:38Z,"Deathsantis has gone around the bend, no hope for him. He believes that Biden is attacking him using Covid. He is crazier than the Sociopathic 70 Year Old Toddler."
2021-12-11T05:41:08Z,What &quot;statistics&quot; are referenced depends on whose video you&#39;re watching. A bit searching of non-CNN/FOX sources of my own revealed that Florida usually wound up in the middle of the heap. Patterns don&#39;t seem to be determined by the red/blue state criteria. Thank you CNN for furthering our stupid tribal habits.
2021-11-29T21:23:03Z,Mini Trump and the Texas clown is getting ready to get it Barry Hall you want to play games here she comes
2021-11-28T08:44:08Z,Boy this didn&#39;t age well... The state with the most old people has the lowest covid rates.

2021-09-26T07:45:29Z,It’s evident Florida urgently needs strong leadership. People are dying- tourists are staying away. Economy will plummet. Terrible leadership
2021-09-25T17:55:48Z,"Those experts are called Doctors, they went to school for 12 plus years!! If ppl follow politicians they are going to be lead down the primrose path!! If you take away his &quot;title&quot;, he&#39;s just another crazy &quot;Florida Man&quot;!!!"
2021-09-24T15:34:12Z,Now starting to look at the G O P with Taliban faces on them.  This has become so sad to think this is now America .  Vote Blue 2022 to fix America
2021-09-23T22:26:26Z,I think Covid has singled out Florida.
2021-09-22T21:47:00Z,There should be a nationwide vote to vaccinate or not to vaccinate.  We are all in this together.
2021-09-21T22:40:11Z,He&#39;s delusional..he thinks he&#39;s going to be President!!?? He can&#39;t Gov the State of Florida...keep dreaming!!
2021-09-21T22:30:20Z,He thinks the Trump supporters are going to follow him!!?? Uh- No.
2021-09-21T17:44:03Z,It makes me sick listening to msnbc can t even listen to the whole thing
2021-09-21T17:42:44Z,He s the best governor bar none and is all common sense you people on the left are so full of bs
2021-09-21T13:39:28Z,Where is your common sense Governor Desantis? You must have left it at Yale and Harvard!  You should be locked in a mental institution? Not only stupid  but delusional!
2021-09-21T11:42:31Z,It&#39;s not stupid any more.<br>It is outright wilful ignorance.<br>Or even outright evil.
2021-09-20T20:33:41Z,We live in the UK and can&#39;t wait to travel to Florida for another holiday. However this nut job is killing people and we aren&#39;t coming to spend serious money on holiday in the killing fields known as Orlando. Please remove this fool.
2021-09-20T18:36:52Z,Mini H*T*ler promoting genocide!
2021-09-20T18:35:33Z,EVER THOUGHT YOU&#39;D SEE THE DAY????<br>When a republican was PRO freedom of choice &amp; democrats were ANTI freedom of choice??
2021-09-20T16:03:37Z,Forget the false retrumpican recall in Cali! Recall Ron DeSantis for killing his own cult members with impunity! This guy is sick and demented! Anything for his cult leader&#39;s smile!
2021-09-20T18:33:33Z,"Since New York &amp; New Jersey, Massachusetts &amp; Rhode Island have higher COVID death rates than Florida, shouldn&#39;t those governors be recalled before DeSantis??"
2021-09-20T13:47:27Z,Yup...... Mini baby donnie..... His brother from another mother!
2021-09-20T00:10:58Z,"Poor libs and MSNBC, can&#39;t handle a successful governor. Of course on the other hand, Biden is there idea of successful.."
2021-09-19T01:54:42Z,Covid vaccines protects you if you have pre existing conditions but doesn&#39;t stop the spread of the virus. A person that has natural immunity or the vaccine can still get sick. So the ppl that has the vaccine you can still get people sick. Think and do research people
2021-09-18T14:11:19Z,allegations made by republicans against democrats apply more to themselves than democrats
2021-09-16T11:42:34Z,"My brother and I, both snowbird, vaccinated Canadians decided against visiting Florida for our other brothers wedding during Desantis&#39; Covid insanity."
2021-09-15T17:51:24Z,"Dear Deathsanta, For Xmas I want a new Mother...mine was killed by Covid because you made her return to work with not enough PPE...could you please make sure she is not a REPUBLICAN and not full of fear??"
2021-09-15T17:46:21Z,he&#39;s backed into a corner and it would be too humiliating to change course now. All of us in Fl. will lose b/c of his intransigence
2021-09-15T13:52:28Z,False news from left wing agenda . Florida is not the worse it is # 13 on list of states . New York blue state toward the top . Vaccines doesn&#39;t stop spread of covid . Unvaccinated or vaccinated spread the virus the same . Vaccine effectiveness on delta variant can&#39;t be measured because cdc stopped counting breakthrew cases in May. <br>False news makes me never trust Biden administration.  MSNBC should be held accountable for broadcasting False narrative
2021-09-14T16:13:36Z,A Moron for Governor. That&#39;s what Florida Elected!
2021-09-14T15:00:14Z,I congratulate Governor Ron DeSantis&#39; on his long assault up to the top of Mount Stupid.
2021-09-12T02:42:26Z,He is still re-electable...
2021-09-11T17:52:54Z,"I am vaccinated. At this point if someone is dumb enough not get vaccinated, they deserve why is coming to them."
2021-09-11T15:55:09Z,Can&#39;t he be recalled
2021-09-11T15:52:31Z,He needs to go in 2022
2021-09-11T02:51:46Z,"What&#39;s it going to take ? How many people have to die for people to get vaccinated ? When it happens to a loved one , empathy starts to set in real fast."
2021-09-11T00:53:23Z,What a disgrace
2021-09-10T18:37:47Z,Too bad there are evil people who still follow that punk
2021-09-10T16:44:31Z,"TALLAHASSEE — Gov. Ron DeSantis quietly signed into law late Monday a bill that will cost Florida consumers who shop online an estimated $1 billion a year in sales taxes, with the money used to cut business taxes.   He is a snake in the grass, all the way around!"
2021-09-09T20:49:55Z,"C’mon Floridians run this clown out of your state, hearts, and minds. Useless, imbicilic and murderous. ‘Nuff said."
2021-09-08T14:04:35Z,"He is a Trump-wannabe , pathetic!"
2021-09-07T12:11:57Z,He is actively killing his own voters. Thanks to him dems may well win because of all the voters he is killing daily.
2021-09-06T14:35:08Z,😢
2021-09-06T13:25:16Z,"BS, we can see how they are politicizing this &quot;virus&quot; and didn&#39;t they already have to correct their numbers when they tried bashing Florida? This plandemic won&#39;t end till they have total control, give the control back to the people cuz this rich people seem to be exempt from the rules. Everybody remember Obama&#39;s big birthday bash where they didn&#39;t wear masks or have social distancing? Oh that&#39;s right only the poor have to be muzzled and distant."
2021-09-06T11:38:13Z,Why are you  so stupid  saying  what you are told by those evildoers democrats  if they have  people  with the virus  it&#39;s because  those evildoers  democrats  bring  in people  from other countries  with the virus
2021-09-06T04:35:09Z,y&#39;all are idiots.  i thought you went out of business. its a shame msnbc cnn and others have been caught in so many lies that we believe the opposite of what little you spew to your tiny audience.
2021-09-05T22:18:38Z,"This is the biggest bunch of crap I have ever read or heard from u media trash people. You know how u help Americans stop the fear mongering u media folks are told to do. Even 3 weeks ago, when this was put out,, our ICU&#39;&#39;S were not over ran and to this day they aren&#39;t. All you have to do is read the title for this video to know how full of it MSNBC is when they put &quot;Mini Trump&quot; in the title...smh. Do yalls job the right way and stop all the lies about everyone that ain&#39;t Democrat and then maybe yall might earn some respect but until then ur plain trash"
2021-09-05T21:44:04Z,"Still sounds like dictatorship!!! Desantis!!! When you try to charge others for your none approval, that&#39;s DICTATOR!! Butt hole...😠😠😠"
2021-09-05T20:57:09Z,"And the stupidity goes on and on and on.  This is more proof that these people have been brainwashed.  And you ask why?  Because they are doing everything they can to stay in control which to them is more important than saving peoples&#39; lives.  Please, folks, take off your Trump colored glasses and get back to being a normal person who would do whatever they could do to save their own lives and the lives of others.  THAT IS WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS NOW!   Take off your Trump cloak and become once again a loving and trusting person who wants to help save lives, including you own, and stop this freakin pandemic NOW!!"
2021-09-05T17:26:08Z,"You whining Florida . You have the best, most sane, most able  Governor in the United States. <br>He will keep your freedoms for you ! Quit being stupid! He is not being exploiting."
2021-09-05T05:01:45Z,I feel so bad for these doctors and nurses who are grappling with all these deaths and people having to fight to breathe. Our beautiful and precious children struggling are to breathe. My heart just breaks. This man needs to be removed immediately.
2021-09-04T21:21:16Z,What a total putz.

2021-08-31T16:41:14Z,They have turned a health issue into a political weapon... First time in history that I see people using a health matter as a political tool!
2021-08-30T16:30:54Z,It’s obviously all democrats commenting
2021-08-30T07:06:08Z,76% of people who were hospitalized with COVID were obese! Talk about that for a change. Push healthier living as hard as you push the vaccine
2021-08-29T12:16:03Z,William walace last words . <br>Freedom . <br>Then he died .. Horribly .
2021-08-29T03:16:52Z,The strange thing is that everyone I know who lives in Florida loves Desantis!  I guess they don&#39;t watch MSNBC.......HAHA
2021-08-29T02:34:12Z,"Florida is far away from the border, yet Florida has the most covid-19. Did the people with the covid go to the border and then returned back to Florida?"
2021-08-27T22:24:50Z,"This is propaganda, misinformation and fear mongering."
2021-08-27T09:18:36Z,Ron DeSantis is killing Our Florida.
2021-08-27T05:51:23Z,"Even if Governor&#39;s are making Covid, Delta. The next variant political how can any parent say I love my kids but Refuse to be vaccinated or wearing a mask."
2021-08-26T21:38:29Z,Don&#39;t blame Joe Biden for your f up! Just like Trump!! Vote him out!!
2021-08-26T16:22:17Z,"How many of these Covid cases are the result of the Biden administration dumping illegals with Covid all over the United Station, including Florida?  Quit trying to make DeSantis look bad.  If people are worried about catching the virus, stay home.  Those of us who&#39;ve had Covid or have been vaccinated shouldn&#39;t be confined to our homes."

2021-08-25T23:37:48Z,"DeSantis reminds me of the Banana Republic ruler, on the Gilligan&#39;s Island Little Dictator episode.<br><br>He&#39;s wants to be Trump&#39;s VP?  Start measuring for that necktie...he tried to give one to Pence."
2021-08-25T16:59:32Z,Don&#39;t Florida my state!
2021-08-25T16:57:33Z,Gaslighting and projecting to take attention away from his failures! He learned well from Trump.
2021-08-25T16:08:01Z,💉💉💉👉⚰⚰⚰⚰⚰⚰⚰
2021-08-25T07:18:38Z,Vote this guy out.
2021-08-24T19:51:47Z,"Whoa!  The record breaking hospitalizations are due to a viral cousin of the original COVID virus, the Delta variant.  The infections are reportedly largely occurring in the unvaccinated.  Gov. DeSantis supported the vaccination program.  He also, after seeing the damage done by the widely imitated business shut-down, stopped such stupidity and the state successfully emerged better than ever from the first wave of the virus - something that many Democratic governors would have been well to emulate.  Our restored restaurant industry among others are grateful to the governor and as a Florida resident, so am I."
2021-08-24T18:59:16Z,Fascist pig desantos
2021-08-24T05:35:14Z,Give me liberty or give me death. Famous last words.
2021-08-24T02:45:56Z,More people vaccinated in Florida that most any otjer state ... deaths of children extremely low. Stop making up facts. Mask mandates NOT effective ... neither are lockdowns!
2021-08-24T02:43:40Z,Parents make the choice for masking NOT the Gov&#39;t
2021-08-23T23:57:08Z,Really? Because I know a lot of people that are going there to vacation and live their and they say otherwise
2021-08-23T23:55:37Z,You folks can talk all you want to about Desaniwipe but as long as Florida is a tourist state the tourist industry and the teachers unions make the calls in Florida. How many people are in Florida right now on vacation? Its at capacity people. Everybody is to blame in Florida for covid. <br> God bless the Americans that the Democratic voters and Shiek Oabandon left in Afghanistan.  Trump 2024
2021-08-23T19:17:10Z,"Child endangerment, Isn&#39;t that illegal in Florida?"
2021-08-23T18:56:40Z,Desantis 2024
2021-08-23T18:49:53Z,He it right.  Many Floridians have it DEAD wrong.  A few hundred a day.  He should be charged with criminal negligence .  The buck stops with him.
2021-08-23T18:10:33Z,Don&#39;t worry about our Governor.  He&#39;s doing fine.  You need to worry about your president the ped0phile.
2021-08-23T13:21:05Z,"Is there even a boarder in Florida, WTF is DeSantis talking about<br>Once apon a time best place to vacation 😌now most deadly place ,<br>roll of the dice 70% you die 30% you live............. Florida 😑 and all Republican run areas WTF is happening 😳"

See a true change for the better for all.  We wouldn&#39;t allow or even accept 10 children a day being put in ICUs from covid. GOP S POLICIES ARE  DE SANTISING FLORIDIANS💀💀💀
2021-08-23T08:40:14Z,Cases are not deaths. Where are the 2021 Florida covid death numbers? Media is just fear mongering
2021-08-22T18:56:55Z,Children&#39;s lives are at stake. Truly horrific. 🤮

2021-08-22T07:09:01Z,Don&quot;t MAKE AMERICA GRAVEYARD AGAIN!
2021-08-22T06:10:57Z,"Shocking that we&#39;re discussing how DeSantis is positioning himself for the presidency by displaying such disregard and apparent contempt for the lives of his own constituents. Horrible is the new great, death the new liberty, and indifference wrapped in ignorance the new driving concern."
2021-08-22T04:36:30Z,By who&#39;s metric?
2021-08-21T21:38:58Z,More lies from the Communist Lamestream Propaganda Mill.

2021-08-21T05:26:08Z,Dirtbag
2021-08-21T04:49:55Z,DeSantis is putting politics over lives. Shame on Him.
2021-08-21T02:30:11Z,Just more main stream Marxist propaganda! Your all such sheeple fools! Really pathetic!
2021-08-21T00:35:27Z,Haha well the citizens of Fl are enjoying living life. While everyone else enjoys lockdowns!!
2021-08-20T22:22:18Z,Virus from around the world by having a wide open Southern Border?? Yes Florida is as south as it gets.
2021-08-20T22:10:47Z,Mini trump?? You literally can’t stop using his name. It’s pathetic. What’s wrong?? Your views down? So you need to throw trump in the title to spice it up. Everyone knows ur a bs news source and it’s only a matter of time until you’re “fans” wake up to this nonstop petty name dropping for clicks.
2021-08-20T21:54:06Z,"Gov DeSantis,<br><br>This is 100% on you.  Stop pandering.  Start leading."
2021-09-12T01:18:14Z,He can&#39;t. He&#39;s not capable of leading.
2021-08-20T21:50:11Z,"Every time he says so called experts and he goes around telling people masks don’t protect and don’t really work, then kids don’t get Covid in schools they get it elsewhere I mean so he is an expert now? They guy who did not know his own medical officials asked the Fed for help with ventilators"
2021-08-20T21:48:26Z,The chump dropped a turd and floated into the shores of Florida
2021-08-20T21:43:07Z,MSNBC hysteria and propaganda! DeSantis is one of the best Governor in America right now.
2021-08-20T17:47:05Z,Those in Florida who refuse to use masks or get vaccinated should be refused medical help when they get sick.
2021-08-20T17:09:00Z,DeSantis is beyond stupid and I hold him wholly responsible for everyone in Florida who comes down with COVID-19 infections or dies from it!
2021-08-20T17:05:32Z,You want to stop covid? Check those that cross the border ilegally.
2021-08-20T12:49:14Z,"MSNBC, where the employees out number the viewers."

2021-08-20T01:50:49Z,"They love to hate DeSantos. Why is that?? Oh yea, because he won&#39;t shut down his state like they have here in CA. Millions upon millions of jobs. Millions of small businesses gone forever, all because of covid. DO you know that about 5 times the number of people die every single day here in America from heart disease. I don&#39;t want to give all you covid experts any ideas, but are we going to shut down the country until we get this heart disease under control? Finally, the hypocrisy you all spew is truly epic. One million illegal immigrants have crossed the souther border since the biden circus rolled into town. Estimates are the 40% of them are covid positive, yet not a peep from any of these people from msnbc, cnn, and all the rest. Why is that? Then your buddy berry has a party and now marth&#39;s vineyard has more cases than at any other time. Did msnbc say anything about the party? Only that the attendees are &quot;sophisticated&quot; so I guess that means they know how to speak virus???? I don&#39;t know. Hypocrites all of you. And now Afghanistan......wow. Good job mr. pres."
2021-08-20T01:07:43Z,"“179 children hospitalized for Covid… “<br><br>Let’s just take that headline as fact. Let’s assume Florida leading the country in hospitalized children is fact.<br><br>What percentage is 179 out of all children in Florida? (Hint: it’s less than 0.00001%)<br><br>How many of those children were actually hospitalized for other serious conditions and just happened to also have Covid? How many are gravely ill specifically due to Covid? How many are likely to make it out alive and well (because children are resilient)? How do these numbers compare to annual state-wide flu statistics on children?<br><br>Call me cold-hearted but even if all claims that Florida is leading the country are true, I wouldn’t bat an eye at such minuscule numbers. We got way bigger issues to worry about, like what’s for lunch tomorrow?"
2021-08-20T00:28:19Z,Deathsantis is planning on opening 50 regeneron clinics which make monoclonal antibodies throughout Florida. He sees it as a guaranteed way to make money for his election for president in 2024. The more viruses the more monoclonal antibodies are needed those who end up dead are viewed as collateral damage
2021-08-20T00:25:21Z,Deathsantis strikes again. In 1905 the Supreme Court set a precedent that during a public health epidemic states have every right to mandate vaccines and masks.
2021-08-20T00:22:49Z,Deathsantis wants to build 50 regeneron clinics which produce monoclonal antibodies across the state of Florida. Some mega donors have convinced him its a money maker for him and his intention is to line his presidential bid for 2024. More COVID cases translates to more money for him and his mega donors. All on the gamble about parents rights. Screw your rights you’re weaponizing the virus banking on your banning of masks to guarantee as many infections as he can. His children have private tutors do yours?
2021-08-19T22:08:37Z,"The Title of this video is a lie.. Florida isn&#39;t experiencing many deaths due to Delta variant...  They&#39;re averaging something like 50 deaths daily (in a state with well over 20 million people, estimated close to 28 million if you included the illegal immigrants) in the peak of the pandemic.. Florida is also the third highest in population state in the USA.."
2021-08-19T21:52:33Z,"Only in the US could you have white supremacists with names like Ubeda, Cruz, Rubio, DeSantis, Fuentes &amp; Enrique all decended from Spain that was occupied for 700 years by North African Berber &amp; Moors. Never mind the Jewish white supremacists like Miller Kushner Levin and the rest, I wonder how they would have gotten along with the German SS while they were pleading how white they were all the way to the gas chambers. When the German SS were kicking in doors, looking for gypsies, what do you think they would have done with a 75 year old fat man who dyes his hair blond and paints himself orange."

2021-08-19T01:10:14Z,He&#39;s giving his constituents what they want...no matter if it kills them. He is wildly irresponsible and ultimately responsible for peoples&#39; deaths.
2021-08-19T01:02:19Z,These headlines crack me up !!!  So predictable
2021-08-18T22:42:25Z,Republicans is all about making money off  stupid people.
2021-08-18T21:37:12Z,Floridian&#39;s who have a vaccination rate of 51.5% are concerned that brown skin immigrants may have Covid
2021-08-18T21:14:35Z,"I don&#39;t care(if Republicans get vaccinated), do you?"
2021-08-18T21:00:54Z,Desantis is &quot;The Death Governor.&quot;
2021-09-22T03:34:56Z,And more amd more of his believers are dying every day from Covid --again.  Wait for the body counts. Regenron helps those identified quickly .it is nit a cure and does not offer long term protection.

2021-08-18T19:19:36Z,AND (IF YOU ARE CAPABLE) READ FROM THE CDC WEBSITE    &quot;Masks &quot;MAY&quot; help people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others. The CDC has &quot;guidance&quot; for wearing masks. Wearing a face mask &quot;MAY LIMIT&quot; exposure to respiratory droplets and large particles and &quot;MAY HELP PREVENT&quot; people who have COVID -19 from spreading the virus. SO TELL ME WHAT REASONING YOU HAVE TO EXPOSE CHILDREN 0-17 TO THE VACCINE COMPARED TO THE VIRUS  ITSELF???
2021-08-18T18:13:20Z,Ron don&#39;t care for Florida rank a form or 445 then Florida people a product people vote for that guy that means I don&#39;t give a crap about about the kids going back to school getting cold back he don&#39;t care if you get sick in Florida needed want to win 2022 election remember people remember don&#39;t vote
2021-08-18T18:05:21Z,"Ironic that the Trump administration gets credit for the vaccine and the speed in which it was available and it&#39;s fun to watch those that hate him enjoy their vaccine. Second, if the vaccine doesn&#39;t stop you from contracting or spreading the virus, what&#39;s the point of a &quot;passport&quot; or &quot;card&quot;....what will happen is people will become convinced that having that card or passport makes you immune or that you can stop worrying about the basics, wash your hands, don&#39;t touch face, social distance blah blah blah. Look, yall want to save lives, how about we start with all the children that will starve to death today or the people in North Korea and China literally being executed. The people not wanting to take an experimental vaccine should be at the bottom of the list.....Unless there is some alterier motive 🤔🤔"

2021-08-18T11:20:59Z,Everything is grim and death and deadly...check out each countries death rates over the past 20 years...then figure who is playing politics. Sickening how bias your news is. It&#39;s okay for people to make up their own minds...not your pathetic news reporting.

Out of 6 techs, 3 are out, 2 with covid. I lost my ability to do my job as a CT tech/X ray tech. Fire rescue brings everyone into our satellite emergency room because all the hospitals are overflowing in Palm Beach County, Fl."

2021-08-17T21:39:59Z,"Fake news, lived in Florida 65 years, all is well, kids have been back in school over a year. If people are so afraid of Covid stop the Super Spreader Event at the border. People are hesitant to get Vaccinated because Joe and Kamala said they didn’t trust ‘Trumps’ vaccine during 2020 campaign… then they both got Vaccine in Dec. 2020. Thats called hypocrisy folks."
2021-08-17T21:29:16Z,"Maybe check your news sources at the state line. We don&#39;t fear Covid in Florida, or your medical vaccine hysteria. People are fleeing liberal states in droves. Where are they going? Florida...You do the math."

2021-08-17T20:51:53Z,"As I&#39;ve said on other threads, I find the anti-masking and anti-vaxx quite incomprehensible. I was born in the shadow of World War Two and just after (b. 1954) where people had to make far greater sacrifices than masking-up and curtailing their social lives. <br><br>My parents&#39; generation had to endure rationing of food (imagine the howls of indignation from present-day Republikkkan overgrown toddlers on being told what they could, and could not, EAT!!), direction of labour and of course the call-up from which some never returned and others, while still alive, were left permanently damaged physically and traumatised mentally (what would now be PTSD, and similar). This applied to the USA as well of course.<br><br>We also took vaccination for granted. Memories of the appalling long-term consequences of, for instance, polio and TB were still very fresh in people&#39;s minds (there&#39;s an old TB isolation hospital near where I live in North Somerset which I think is now flats). We do have some idiots here in the UK but perhaps not quite so many or so vocal as elsewhere."
2021-08-17T20:42:00Z,The state is at its biggest emergency!! Yet our governor took away the state emergency order!   !!!

2021-08-17T12:25:53Z,"it is increasingly scary to be living in FL given the LACK of freedoms increasingly growing from the autocratic style governance.  ok, so personal choice is his prominent message but he allows archiac gun laws (i.e. stand your ground) to place citizens at risk, he supports &#39;no abortion&#39; government laws (woman&#39;s personal choice), he holds back reinstating civil rights to felons (A &quot;yes&quot; vote supported this amendment to automatically restore the right to vote for people with prior felony), he continues to be a mini me of an unstable minded man and use hyperbole rhetoric which is false. sigh......FL citizens, please reflect on your votes the next elections,  you can choose better....go Val Demmings, replace rubio who has done very little for citizens of this Fl state; go Nikki Fried, replace mini me desantis.  With more strong women in government positions (please research how New Zealand and Germany leadership, both lead by strong, intelligent women, have weathered through this pandemic), we may be able to restore decency and intelligent governance for the public good.

2021-08-17T03:50:11Z,A weak mind in charge! Less than 55 percent of Floridians are vaccinated.This virus is a killer. It jams hospitals  with long term care patients many of whom will die. Other patients who need critical surgery or other serious care can&#39;t get a bed because the beds are full of people who wouldn&#39;t get vaccinated. Any observant person driving our roads can see how people drive here and these same people are the same ones who won&#39;t get vaccinated. Ignorance is not bliss!! Neither is stupidity!!
2021-08-17T03:44:28Z,Did you know that Desantis represents his constituents?
2021-08-17T03:43:16Z,"You&#39;d have some validity to bag desantis if you asked the actual questions about masks not working, vaccinated people spreading covid, and the fact that the virus is never going back into the Wuhan lab, so how can people stop living in fear."

Seriously.  Mask mandates, asking for social distancing, extra cleaning and such...even requiring children to be properly vaccinated unless there are valid medical reasons why they should be exempted - these are good, sensible measures to take to protect both children and adults from deadly diseases.  Florida is not Plague Central. The only tyranny at work here is the insane game of doing everything possible to deny local communities and private businesses from protecting their citizens and customers."

2021-08-16T03:12:50Z,DeSantis is the grim reaper and why is he allowed to do this !!!
2021-08-16T03:03:20Z,"I hope he’s a mini trump. That’s what America needs. Not Biden and his list of failed policies. It’s sad that Americans do such little research on all the great things trump did while in office, and disregard our awful border, our awful taxes, our booming inflation, weakened economy, homeless crisis, crime rate is skyrocketing due to defunding the police, yet hypocritical democratic mayors have 24-7 around the clock police presence at their houses. And all uninformed Americans say is trump is “mean” and a “Cheeto face”.. I hope America wakes up soon and realizes Biden is probably the worst president in history and the facts are right in front of them. But all you have to do to get a Democrat vote is give them a 600 dollar stimulus check. SAD"
2021-08-16T02:59:41Z,The next POTUS! DeSantis is a great man and Florida is thriving.<br>Death rates are DOWN!!!
2021-08-16T02:50:13Z,Did he really just try to blame the epidemic in Florida on the media or am I just really super drunk
2021-08-16T02:45:43Z,Do Florida schools dress codes interfere with parents&#39; right?
2021-08-16T02:18:36Z,"just what florida needs when people are sick and dying , a tRump clone ☹️"
2021-08-16T02:13:42Z,DeSantis since he doesn&#39;t want anybody to get vaccinated or wear masks if anybody needs medical care then he should pay for all their medical care let the Santos and Florida since everybody loves to Santa but Florida and DeSantis pay the bill pay all the medical bills for all the people in Florida

The democratic liberal party is scared to death of Ron DeSantis becoming President in a few years and they will do anything and everything to discredit him. DO NOT BELIEVE THIS UNETHICAL HIT PIECE. It is brought to you by the same people that are trying to destroy the American way of life, steal your personal freedoms, deceive you with every breath and buy votes with trillions of free dollars that someone is going to have to repay eventually."

2021-08-15T18:14:56Z,Somebody check DeSantis campaign donations.. see how many are from the funeral industry and how many are from real estate groups..   funeral industry as the government is paying for covad victims to be buried and real estate groups as the homes and condos left behind could be snatched up by investment groups to raise the rents and collect billions a month in rents and lease payments.

Being vaccinated will not stop death.

EVERYONE WILL DIE SOMEDAY AND STAND BEFORE THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST. I DONT CARE WHAT YOU BELIEVE  OR WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE. BEFORE YOU TAKE YOUR LAST BREATH  YOU BETTER HOPE YOU WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE  DECISIONS THAT YOU MADE DURING YOUR LIFE.

Keep suppressing people like Dr.Peter McCullough. Promote the vaccine that will be catastrophic to the future of our childrens health. Why don&#39;t these news channels show both sides of the misery that has been unleashed on us. If everyone got vaccinated today covid wouldn&#39;t go away for a long time and all the vaccinated would be dependent on the needle for the rest of their lives.

2021-08-17T02:39:31Z,They will be lying in graves soon enough.  It’s amazing how people who refused to get vaccinated then demand to have their unvaccinated loved one be transferred to a hospital with a higher level of care and more treatment modalities for COVID. Plenty of these types living in my mother’s complex. They seem so shocked when talking to the “manager” doesn’t work.

It’s a beautiful privilege to exercise providing you don’t allow your decisions/actions/comments to be dictated by a political party."
2021-08-14T21:01:05Z,One fact is that natural immunity is not permanent and it’s not 100% effective. Vaccines can help increase your chances to not get the virus. Another fact is that places like private businesses and schools have the freedom to restrict anyone’s rights if they are on their property. I’m all for choice but you don’t and shouldn’t have the right to choose if you are on someone else’s property.

2021-08-14T17:31:11Z,I live in south Florida and hate everything about how he’s handled it. I’m also immunocompromised and feel so unsafe with the lack of mandates. No one wears masks. No one seems to understand how serious the virus is. No one seems to care. I was hoping Biden would put an executive order in place at least for the masks.
2021-08-14T17:27:34Z,"I have lived in Florida my entire adult life, and coming from a Latin American country, I never thought that I would see neglect like this, DeSantis is not fit to be governor, he&#39;s dangerous and is responsible for the deaths of man, women and children."
2021-08-14T17:26:07Z,"Does De&#39;Santis realize that Florida and Mexico don&#39;t have a shared border, or is he just trying to deflect scrutiny from his failure to limit the spread of Covid 19 in Florida?"
2021-08-14T17:20:55Z,You will get your freedom but you may not be alive to enjoy it
2021-08-14T17:13:34Z,"Ron DeSantis has one thing in mind...moving his political ambitions. He does not care about the safety of his constituents, which includes doctors, nurses, food supply workers, teachers, students and &quot;you&quot;..."
2021-08-14T17:12:57Z,Why is DeSantis even attempting to wear a mask at all if he is banning their use???  He is the worst!!!!!
2021-08-14T17:05:48Z,Send cameras in ICU the world needs to see
2021-08-14T16:59:32Z,New York has a much higher death rate than Florida. Fake News!
2021-08-14T16:58:19Z,Ron. Mini. Trump. Is. Very.  Corrupt  and   stupid
2021-08-14T16:44:48Z,Why isnt anyone trying to recall this joke?!
2021-08-14T16:38:38Z,these people should face serious charges
2021-08-14T16:36:12Z,"Maybe Desantis is really messing up but I’m sorry I’m not gonna believe a bunch of stats and info from mainstream media, their legitimacy is in question"
2021-08-14T16:31:55Z,CRIMES AGAINST MAN!

2021-08-14T16:29:15Z,How about Louisiana?  Higher daily cases and spread thank FL. Not to mention one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country. Maybe it’s because the Governor is a Democrat?  Ari and MSNBC have a clear agenda.
2021-08-14T16:26:16Z,did the same with the surfside building collapsed photo op...total dirtbag...👈😮👿🤬🐷🤢👇

2021-08-14T16:24:20Z,Oh yes force people to get vaccinated. It is not like is tyranny or control the people. Bye freedom
2021-08-14T16:23:06Z,If liberals could even understand facts and take in the truth of the propaganda they help propagate.  How you like the gas prices and the new Russian pipeline approved by Biden?  There is no need for vaccines and masks that don&#39;t work.  Go catch your Delta with your vaccinated body...foolish.  Fauci even said masks don&#39;t work.  When will you wake up?
2021-08-14T16:21:25Z,If DeSantis wants assistance from the Federal Government he must step down he is no leader in order to get assistance.  DeSantis is the cause of the disaster he&#39;s state is facing at this time.  DeSantis is not being a leader to the  state he is being a typical Republican.   He is being crazy as some Republicans are honestly I&#39;m sure he is vaccinated already.   Republicans don&#39;t believe in the vaccine but many have already been vaccinated.  God Bless America.

2021-08-14T15:29:58Z,Desantis is a waste of space on this earth.
2021-08-14T15:23:47Z,He only thinks of himself and not take care of his constituents. What are you doing to your state?  You were voted to serve and where is your conscience?

2021-08-14T13:43:31Z,I&#39;ve been saying since this pandemic started that DeSantis is killing us in Florida with his stupid trump like decisions. He just keeps going with the same idiotic base driven choices that are literally killing us.  4 teachers from one county in Florida are dead within hrs of each other. 😢
2021-08-14T13:43:01Z,didn’t Biden declare everyone against Covid19 measure a terrorist? He should just go take Desantis out under his new rule! Just put the national guard down there to and take all the Florida terrorist out!!
2021-08-14T13:40:39Z,Trump lost with his Covid denial and injecting bleach and UV lights bs. DeSantis thinks him doing the same thing is a winning strategy. It&#39;s unbelievable and if Covid taught us anything we got a front row seat to the corruption of self serving politicians. That includes corporate Dems they would rather a Republican over a progressive who don&#39;t take corporate $$$. The crazier thing is Trump and his ilk who are for corporations and power have these maga people thinking they care about them. It&#39;s their bigotry and fear that bind them bc if your not rich they don&#39;t give a F about you.

I don&#39;t think the doctors and nurses can be pushed much further.  Aside from not having hospital beds, there won&#39;t be anybody to care for those getting infected.  <br>This is a shameful response.  Where are all the patriots that &quot;love&quot; this country?

2021-08-14T13:03:29Z,Biden is bringing in millions of immigrants with covid and there are more states then fl.agreeing with de esantis biden is the failure for this country 2022 America will be worse than ever if <br>Biden still president
2021-08-14T13:03:22Z,"Religious choice for anything, let alone to not get vaccinated is one of the stupidist things I&#39;ve ever heard of. Where in any religious historical records has there ever been moral discussions over things like vaccines? lol. These are all anti-science decisions made by ideologues based on their feelings. It&#39;s like saying &quot;I&#39;m not going to stop smoking in crowded public spaces due to my religion&quot; - this is a highly contagious respiratory virus transmitted through aerosols - your &quot;freedom&quot; puts others in harms way"

2021-08-14T12:54:04Z,Awsome job de Santis. It&#39;s strange how the left media puts up videos trying to bash de Santis but everyone agrees with these short clips. The Democrats are easy to laugh at. The stink of their desperation will cause more damage to our environment and country than oil ever has.
2021-08-14T12:50:24Z,Big surprise. They know de Santis will be the Republican candidate. They will go ahead and start making up lies and propaganda. Hilarious. This tabloid thinks it&#39;s opinion is taken seriously. MSNBC may be worse than CNN. Nothing has ever been worse in the USA than the modern Democrat party. De Santis for president.

2021-08-14T12:30:42Z,His actions will backfire on him as more children  die.  Children must get certain vaccinations before starting school.  Masks 😷are an easy start to stiffle infection rates.  Patents who love their children will protect them.
2021-08-14T12:30:13Z,If Floridians want to let there governor tell them no rules then let them died its on them. Its there kids. Drs n nurses are thought  to saves life but they need to do there homework n find out if thus have to take it there first shot of vaccibune if not next up let them died.

2021-08-14T12:29:33Z,Desantis has always had the cringy use car salesman vibe
2021-08-14T12:28:54Z,Dropped by msnbc to see how the other side is living. Same sensationalist bs as always. Why is this guy talking like a teenage tik tok star. He literally said literally. The government has no rights to your kids and never should. He has not once mentioned what percentage of Covid cases are children.
2021-08-14T12:23:47Z,Florida is looking to evacuate all life from their state! Seniors go there to retire. But now anyone of all ages can go to Florida to die.
2021-08-14T12:22:37Z,De Santis shows that stupidity has no limits...
2021-08-14T12:09:58Z,Ron Desantis is a murderer who is capitalizing on the lives of the constituents who are too stupid to notice.
2021-08-14T12:09:32Z,What&#39;s up with Florida hospitals still not mandating their staff to be vaccinated...stupid.
2021-08-14T12:08:43Z,Their money is a lot more important than the concern&#39;s of the people. Shutting down the country puts everyone on an equal playing field.

2021-08-14T11:56:14Z,"Looks like what’s going to happen is vaccinated voters will live to vote in 2022 and anti vaccination proponents won’t be around to vote. If the anti-vaccinators are republicans, who’ll be left to elect DeSantis?"

2021-08-14T11:48:16Z,Desantis trying to pave the way to the white house with the gravestones of his constituents.

2021-08-16T17:17:31Z,"@@kenkal1829 Republican lawmakers are claiming a large percentage of migrants at crowded southern border facilities are testing positive for COVID-19.<br>CapRadio’s PolitiFact California reporter Chris Nichols spoke with afternoon anchor Mike Hagerty about that and other claims in this week’s Can You Handle The Truth segment.<br>This interview has been edited for clarity and length.<br><br>Interview Highlights<br><br>On what is happening at the southern border<br>In recent months, there’s been a really big wave of migration. Border patrol agents have recorded more than half a million encounters with migrants since October. That’s nearly three times as many in the same period a year earlier.<br>So, conditions are very crowded at border detention centers, and some Republican members of Congress are claiming that crowding is leading to the rapid spread of COVID-19.<br>Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma recently visited a border detention center in Donna, Texas and posted a video on Twitter with some claims:<br>“We have a large percentage of folks here that are COVID positive,” Lankford said. “But they’re not tested here for several days. So, they’re literally spreading it all around. And they’re released into HHS custody and into the rest of the country.”<br>On the veracity of those claims<br>PolitiFact found there is no definitive answer available since there are different categories of migrants being tested at different times and by varying groups across the border.<br>But back in March, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency told lawmakers that the positivity rates for people coming across the border at the time was less than 6%. For some comparison, the average positivity rate in Texas was above 7% at that time.<br>On testing migrants for COVID-19 and who is doing it<br>Immigration authorities said they are working with state and local authorities and non-governmental groups to make sure that all migrants are tested “at some point during their immigration journey.”<br>Federal health officials say that the many unaccompanied minors who have arrived are tested every three days — those who test positive are isolated from the rest.<br>Customs and Border Protection personnel do initial checks for symptoms, and they consult with onsite medical staff. People who are presumed to be sick are sent to local health systems for testing, diagnosis and treatment, according to immigration officials.<br>Cities, counties and nonprofits handle the vast majority of the testing and any subsequent isolation.<br>On the work of nonprofit groups<br>One example of what nonprofits do is the Jewish Family Service of San Diego. They help asylum-seekers reunite with their families in California and around the country.<br>They told PolitiFact that many of these people who have had to remain in Mexico are being tested for COVID-19 in that country. Then they are tested again in the United States and remain in hotel rooms while awaiting results."

Moderna boss said he expects booster shots to begin this fall! As for masks the only masks 95% effective are 3-M&#39;s N-95 or a knockoff made in China that China inspects for accuracy. Every other mask is in the low 40&#39;s!! If you remember when this started the N-95 were reserved for hospitals and first responders only. 3-M has a supply at the moment! SO two jabs will not be enough and only the N-95 will give you the best protection!

2021-08-14T05:21:14Z,If you want to avoid those horrible lockdowns get the vaccination and wear the effing mask. The policies of covid spreading DeSantis will wreak havoc on Florida`s economy. I would certainly not book a cruise on a ship that does not have a vaccination mandate.

2021-08-14T04:28:44Z,I wonder how much stock DeathSantis owns in coffin-making companies......
2021-08-14T04:20:33Z,Despite this people of Florida will still vote for him. The only question is how many people will die trying
2021-08-14T04:18:09Z,Yes HE IS

2021-08-14T03:43:37Z,"I saw a comment below about criminal negligence. That is EXACTLY what I was thinking he should be charged with. Not being a legal expert, I don&#39;t know who would bring the charges &amp; such. Given his ignorant &amp; callous decision(s) against ANYTHING Covid  related &amp; helpful , would there have to be a law to violate first? But yet, he&#39;s insane, he goes against the public good. There&#39;s got to be some way to knock his Di*k in the dirt (a colorful expression from an acquaintance of mine) and SHUT HIM UP.<br>DaSantaclausis, stick your crap about freedom, civil liberties where the sun don&#39;t shine. Absolutely NO ONE has the right to  be a walking disease spreader. I don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s fat a*s in a cheese factory that it may be or is &quot;Unconstitutional&quot; to mandate shots &amp; masks. I&#39;ll say it again, this IS a public health emergency; people are sick, &amp; others dead due to the Covid, and now it&#39;s even more evil twin , the Delta variant. <br>It drives me nuts how this governor can be so callous towards hospital ER&#39;s and all the sick children. I see that his kids are too young to attend school. No wonder he shrugs off the kids issue. And then to THREATEN someone&#39;s income/livelihood because they are smart enough &amp; socially/morally responsible enough to take action when he is NOT? Spiteful.<br>Hopefully he&#39;ll get buried under so many lawsuits it&#39;ll shut him up &amp; make him irrelevant."

2021-08-14T01:42:23Z,Is DeSantis sending his 3 children to school without masks? I wonder how he would feel if his children got covid.
2021-08-16T17:48:54Z,Kenneth his children go to private school WHERE masks are MANDATED. So he&#39;s putting children who attend public schools lives in danger. Who attends public education? Mostly black and brown children. Get it!!!
2021-08-17T00:30:59Z,Me too
2021-08-17T03:55:38Z,Thank you for telling me where he sends his children. Very interesting

2021-08-14T01:36:48Z,If everyone can make their own decisions why does he not want to let women get abortions?  He’s a joke. Half the people in Florida can’t stand DeSantis. That’s why they’re doing all the voter laws because he will lose and his cronies will lose their jobs too.
2021-08-14T01:33:34Z,This is a wicked thing he is doing.

2021-08-14T01:28:55Z,Easy to fix vaxx problem. Insurance companies should no longer cover people who don&#39;;t get vaccinated and get sick. They should pay out of pocket because it&#39;s their own fault for getting sick. Put your money where your mouth is.
2021-08-14T01:27:25Z,I hope Desantis get out of the stuck on stupid mentality. If he is doing this on purpose he should be charged with genocide. Isn&#39;t this the correct charge?<br>God Bless

2021-08-14T01:17:21Z,"Like the former president, DeSantis is clearly more focused on his own political ambitions than<br>the lives of the very people who elected him. That said, it&#39;s also virtually guaranteed the former president<br>is directing the Florida governor with promises that, like so many others, will fail to transpire. <br>However, it is always astounding, but unsurprising, that Republicans like Cruz and DeSantis clearly feel so comfortable continuing to argue against mask mandates though the private schools their own children attend require them. Virtually everything Republicans do and say continues to ooze hypocrisy. Like never before Americans need to demand the truth from all elected officials at all times. The United States has continued to encounter one problem after another the result of lies perpetuated by individuals who claim to have the nations best interest at heart as they do otherwise. <br>Whether a hope to avoid a difficult discussion or an attempt to maintain their own chosen narrative, history shows Americans die as a result of the Republican lack of reaction and/or ability to look the other way. The potential for considerable tragedy should motivate some kind of preventative reaction, however, it becomes abundantly clear the only reaction is one that benefits themselves. <br>That&#39;s not to say Americans don&#39;t die under Democratic administrations, of course, people die every day, but, it is a fact more preventable American deaths occur under Republicans.<br>In the &#39;80s, Reagen and Bush Sr. made every attempt to avoid even discussing the AIDS epidemic publically. AIDS was first identified in 1981, but, Reagan did not mention it publicly for several more years, notably during a press conference in 1985 and several speeches in 1987. Sadly, over 40,000 died. Under Bush Jr. months previous to 9/11, in the spring of 2001, the CIA repeatedly and urgently began to warn the White House an attack was coming. Sadly, again, the GOP lack of reaction resulted in 2,977 dead, and more than 6,000 injured, when the twin towers fell. Followed, by Hurricane Katrina, in August 2005, 1,200 more Americans died, and $125 billion in damage occurred. The toll of Katrina was a result of President Bush&#39;s lack of planning, lack of coordination and lack of overall leadership. Unfortunately, thousands more died and many trillions more were spent on the Republican multi-decade Middle East war. <br>Finally, COVID-19, better known as the Trump debacle, well, one of many, a president&#39;s absolute failure to react to a deadly virus, which left 400,000 dead by the time he, another Republican president, left the WH. To date, the US still has the largest death toll in the world. Sadly, it&#39;s a considerable possibility there will never be a true awareness of how many Americans died. As well, the former president&#39;s dishonesty also cost long trusted and respected government agencies their reputations following they&#39;re being instructed to repeat dishonest information to benefit one man&#39;s own narrative. Clearly, there are no limits, when it comes to serving anyone the GOP continue to display it is them that comes first at the expense of far too many."

2021-08-14T00:38:24Z,Desantis needs to be placed in a COVID ward and locked in till he tells the truth!
2021-08-14T00:38:19Z,Florida is a lost cause.  The governor  doesn&#39;t care
2021-08-14T00:35:11Z,This disgusting criminal Governor should be charged with reckless endangerment.

2021-08-14T00:31:34Z,"All this tough talk is directed at Trump&#39;s base. Desantis doesn&#39;t want mask mandates because some MAGA mom is going to get angry Little Timmy doesn&#39;t want to wear a mask. Of course, he&#39;s trying to make it out between him and Biden. Biden says move out the way DeSantis says he&#39;ll be standing in the way if you&#39;re going to force mask mandates. The right still politizing the pandemic. A simple thing might be to point out Trump lost 2020 due to his handling of covid. Desantis will suffer the same fate."
2021-08-14T00:31:26Z,screw these people let them die for their beliefs.  Wars are lot won by dying for what you believe in. They are won by having the other guy die for his.
2021-08-14T00:30:40Z,I   totally support Ron
2021-08-14T00:28:01Z,It becomes a pandemic for the unvaccinated and virus is raging the state with high number of people not vaccinated. The data is there 95 % hospitalized Covid patients are not vaccinated. This is when the leadership is critical. The “mini trump” De santis should be put in jail for harming people and country. I just hope that somebody whose family and loved one died of Covid will figure out who was responsible for that. D.E. Santis should resign or be in prison
2021-08-14T00:27:36Z,Yup blood is on his hands hard to politic that away!!

2021-08-14T00:25:28Z,"I just wish the unvaccinated would promise not to take up coveted hospital space when they eventually get Covid. If you are against the science of vaccines, fine. Just please be a real man (or woman), stick to your anti-science morals and suffer in the privacy of your own home. Because it could have been prevented.  Absolutely no sympathy from me.  None."

2021-08-31T04:29:14Z,"Sure is funny how so many republicans supported banning smoking in restaurants in many places citing health reasons, but wearing a mask is too much for them...for HEALTH REASONS.  They are despicable. I despise republicans."
2021-08-31T04:50:04Z,@@rockybalboa4593 I agree completely.

2021-08-14T00:04:43Z,I think this has evolved into the DESANTIS VARIANT.

2021-08-13T23:36:36Z,DeSantis is using Covid 19 for campaigning rather than do anything to actually control the spread of Covid 19. He is putting politics over lives. Is that really what Floridians want? Which Floridians want to die to support his politics?
2021-08-13T23:36:32Z,"i can&#39;t believe Covid-shaming is still a thing.... do all these people REALLY think our policies make any difference with Covid? masks work - people are still claiming that? even the vaccine seem to be failing, but never mind that - let&#39;s require them anyway"

2021-08-13T23:30:38Z,These anti-vaxers are deliberately allowing c-19 to not only  exist but to flourish. It will not stop until most/all are finally stricken. And 99% are republicans or kids of republicans. This may result in Florida becoming a swing state.
2021-08-13T23:29:02Z,I think it&#39;s time to recall DeathSantis. I&#39;m sure there are enough signatures in Florida now to trigger it.

Freedom for yourself is fine as long as it does not effect others.

But they are viral carriers endangering others such as children who can&#39;t vaccinate. They should either vaccinate or should be ostracized like our other ostracized viral carriers RATS, BATS, ROACHES and MOSQUITOES, PESTS!

2021-08-13T23:02:25Z,"There&#39;s already enough bullying in schools.  The anger we see in the adults who do not want to wear masks themselves, will be reflected and acted out by their children in the schools.  Kids will be picked on and bullied at all levels because of this situation - it&#39;s horribly cruel and frightening actually.  After watching this particular video I hope that the Department of Homeland Security will get involved because we&#39;re seeing domestic terrorism in this situation.<br>An additional point I&#39;d like to make is that even after people get the vaccine, whether they be children or adults, they must mask for several months in order to keep from catching COVID-19 or any of the other variants while the series of vaccination shots are working within their immune systems.  That crowd of people yelling at the masked parents was extraordinarily harsh and ignorant because for all anyone knows, the masked people could have just recently taken their vaccination."

2021-08-13T22:09:27Z,It sounds like desantos could be called a murderer of his people in Florida !!!
2021-08-13T22:03:01Z,DeSantis should be removed from the governorship because he doesn&#39;t care about his people they need Mass mandates vaccines !!!
2021-08-13T21:58:32Z,The media misses Trump so much that they need to label somebody else to demonize.
2021-08-13T22:09:30Z,Who else are they gonna point to when Florida is surpassing New York and NJ for COVID infections? When a vaccine that is proven to seriously reduce transmission and death is available? It’s like choosing to get sick out of spite at this point.
2021-08-17T22:37:23Z,"@@andrepugliese1512 imagine a vaccine so safe that you’ve got to be mandated to take it for a virus so deadly you have to be tested to know if you have it,."
2021-08-18T00:26:53Z,@@genoparedes6032 yeah why don’t you actually comment on what I say next time goon
2021-08-13T21:58:05Z,"I live in Texas, and can assure you, our southern border is not &quot;wide open&quot;.  Lots of Border Patrol &amp; TXDPS officers, Electronic Surveillance, and a harsh, dry, arid land."
2021-08-13T21:57:44Z,DeSantis always reminds me of one of those unpopular punks at school that suffered with anger issues
2021-08-13T21:56:49Z,"Next election, if you want a lunatic in charge vote for duuusantis."
2021-08-13T21:55:46Z,"You don&#39;t know what the help you&#39;re talking about.  It&#39;s the fault of the un-vaccinated that the virus outbreak is going up again. <br><br>DeSantis has f FL up .  Basically telling parents that their kids should die from the virus.<br><br>  It&#39;s commonsense to get vaccinated and wear masks for your kids.  You don&#39;t have the right to get other kids killed or infected. <br><br>That&#39;s what these anti-American idiots are basically saying. They want to infect your kids.  Cause not wearing a mask and getting vaccinated will increase that happening."
2021-08-13T21:53:33Z,"What a lot of (unvaccinated) people don&#39;t realize is that when they need an ICU bed for heart attacks, strokes, traumatic injuries and other life-saving emergencies, they are not going to be available due to all the Covid cases. It&#39;s not like all these possibilities are going to disappear because Covid dominates the landscape. And, it&#39;s especially frustrating when the vaccinated people who are following the Covid guidelines need ICU support."
2021-08-13T21:52:20Z,...how long will MSM keep promoting masks and other measures that have not worked during the entire Covid experience.
2021-08-13T22:16:18Z,"Masks don’t work when enough idiots don’t wear them. It’s mutual protection. A condom is 99% effective at preventing pregnancy when properly used, and 99% (of that left over 1%) more effective when paired with female birth control when properly used. That’s how masks work. Protection multiplies when everyone gets vaccinated or mask up."
2021-08-13T21:50:18Z,"MSNBC has lied this entire time. It&#39;s no way it&#39;s telling the truth now. What MSNBC reports is political propaganda, not neutral information."
2021-08-13T21:47:42Z,"With Florida being so infected and getting worse by the minute, everyone will stay away thus meaning  businesses will extremely suffer. Desantis will be blamed for this. The blood of anyone who perishes by Covid will be on the hands of DeSantis. He will lose like Trump. Political Suicide."
2021-08-13T21:46:28Z,"That guy ??? De Santis, I think an evil force has control of his brain. His thinking is so wrong and stupid."
2021-08-13T21:44:31Z,is De Santis vaccined? Is he?...
2021-08-13T21:44:08Z,Let’s make Florida pay their fair share of taxes too!  Otherwise let them lay in the hole they dug for themselves!  DeSantis is digger in chief at the graveyard!
2021-08-13T21:44:04Z,At some point people have to take responsibility for themselves
2021-08-13T21:43:40Z,"He  reminds me of Patrick character from Sponge Bob . Yes ,stupid."
2021-08-13T21:38:47Z,What is wrong with the Dems? Why are they so cold hearted to their own constituents?
2021-08-13T21:35:50Z,"If its a private company thats operating under their own funds, DeSantis has absolutely ZERO say in that. Overstepping your boundaries there, get off your high horse shorty."
2021-08-13T21:33:45Z,"The reality for Ron DeSantis, is doing what he is told by Donald J Trump  because that&#39;s exactly is who is in control of Florida.  DeSantis will be the reason why he will be the  reason for the  collapse of  Florida&#39;s economy and tourism. Who&#39;s going to travel to  Florida to risk their lives and health to contract SARS-CoV-2 COVID19 VIRUSES . The political situation that has plagued this virus is spreading faster than the virus itself."
2021-08-13T21:32:48Z,That&#39;s the same guy that deemed wrestling fights as essential??
2021-08-13T21:29:54Z,"I really dont understand these headlines, some times.  Just last week, he was leading the 2024 prospects.  But I&#39;m to believe this week that &quot;his career has been hurt&quot;.  ..... whatever."
2021-08-13T21:29:16Z,louisiana is pretty bad. in new iberia no one wears a mask and that was before vaccinations were being put out. people stopped wearing them completely in baton rouge when we all got vaccines but when cdc started saying we needed to wear masks inside a lot of people in BR have started again
2021-08-13T21:29:03Z,15.000 in a week!!!! De Santis is a fake governor without a spine and brain.
2021-08-13T21:25:19Z,"It is beyond belief that America is so divided and  in a mess...Republicans don&#39;t have a clue on how to share their role in governing America....They want to be the boss or no deal.. it is a shame that  educated and supposedly smart individuals can not come together, negotiate and compromise and arrive at a reasonable agreement to do what is good for all America.. Trump infected our politics and now DeSantis and Republican governors are acting  irresponsibly and recklessly with the lives of their constituents.. people who are vaccinated are protected against the coronavirus that is why hospitals are 90% occupied by the unvaccinated. THESE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS WHO ARE AGAINST VACCINATION SHOULD VISIT HOSPITALS AND SEE FOR THEMSELVES ...DESANTIS AND OTHER GOVERNORS AREBNOT EXPERTS, NOT DOCTORS, NOT SCIENTISTS BUT THEY ARE MAKING DECISIONS THAT COULD  KILLED PEOPLE..WE WATCHED JIMJONES LEAD HIS FELLOWERS TO THEIR DEATH AND SOCIETY SAID NOTHING AND NOW OUR SO CALLED LEADERS ARE LEADING US THE WRONG DIRECTION... MR BIDEN IS FOLLOWING THE ADVICE OF OUR DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS AND  OUR GOVERNORS PLAYING WITH OUR LIVES.  .THESE GOVERNORS ARE INCOMPETENT AND MISINFORMED YET THEY PRETEND TO KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS...HOW COULD AMERICA BE SO DIVIDED AND IN CHAOS???"
2021-08-13T21:25:07Z,MSNBC all lies as usual
2021-08-13T21:24:57Z,Its truly terrible what  happening in the State - BUT WHY is nobody commenting/reporting on the comparison /differences between the USA &amp; Canada - specifically the amount of Covid cases in Ontario? eh!!!! what&#39;s wrong with reporting this: the BORDER IS NOT JUST A SIMPLE INVISIBLE LINE.....because of Trumps attitude the States are looking pretty stupid compared to Canadians.....right....even though we have our doubters we still do the right thing (on average) &amp; take into consideration of others. Our collective consciousness in Canada is way above...more evolved compared with the USA &amp; it only because of 1 person Trump...ya all should be embarrassed. A border should \not be a perception line nor an attitude line &amp; see the difference in Ontario....do you see!!!!!
2021-08-13T21:24:11Z,DeSantis should step down.  He is guilty of dereliction of duty.
2021-08-13T21:18:57Z,Ideal Republican candidate. Trump clone.
2021-08-13T21:17:43Z,"There should be an executive order from the white house, allowing the Hospitals to refuse admission to any person that is not vaccinated. If you don&#39;t respect medical advice, why are you asking the Doctors to help you if you get sick.???"
2021-08-13T21:17:19Z,Can we spell LOSER?
2021-08-13T21:15:13Z,"I guess being GQP means no laws affect you, no matter how many people are harmed."
2021-08-13T21:14:17Z,If &quot;Non-Vax&quot; Covid victims call 911 should a hospital be commpelled to admit them?
2021-08-13T21:13:41Z,"Teachers, &quot;I was just joshing, you knw kidding, about that pay thing. Make sure to remember to vote for me&quot;."
2021-08-13T21:13:20Z,"You cannot have it both ways --- If you are Anti Vaccine and Anti-Mask, then don&#39;t go to hospital if you get sick. And the hospitals should not admit any person that cannot provide proof of vaccination. This would prevent Hospitals from being overwhelmed."
2021-08-13T21:11:12Z,i am in southwest Florida. This is not all fact. he does not know who is fighting to breath or dying in FL. No actual facts! just a guy talking his opinion about some place he is not.  il trust God and keep my rights over trusting an unproven vaccine and cloth mask that most ppl dont even wear correctly. If vaccine and mask worked that great why are states with all the rules in reality struggling just as bad as FL and if look at actual numbers worst places. How did it work in Cali or New york. All those rules controlling your life and its no diff. can play messages from PPL that say the exact opposite of his recordings. ALL OPINION. Im struggling to breath from all the opinions that have no data to back up. One news for one and one news for the other and no political party cares about you! Trust in God and make best choices for you for where you live and whats going on there. Godbless!!!
2021-08-13T21:10:58Z,This makes me SO CRAZY!! I have a second home in Orlando . Been down here for 3 weeks now and its a nightmare!!  So many people sick and scared and suffering these fools.

2021-08-13T21:04:10Z,He looks clueless :-(
2021-08-13T21:03:35Z,DeSantis need a geographical lesson..since when has  Florida been on the Southern border...<br>More Republican GOP Q party Cult scare tactics. <br>Differ from the real problem to change narrative on his not handling the Covid infection rate and blame others.<br>DeSantis owns this mess..
2021-08-13T21:03:22Z,People of Florida give this guy the boot while you are still able to breathe.
2021-08-13T21:03:11Z,dying of covid to own the libs
2021-08-13T21:01:37Z,Why haven’t Floridians filed a class action suit for wrongful death against Da Santis???
2021-08-13T21:00:06Z,"De Santis. Is going to hit the ground, when the ants 🐜  start to eat him up. With such a radical governor killing his state&#39;s people."
2021-08-13T20:59:34Z,I just watched a video about a father who&#39;s child and I mean under 2 years of age in the ICU with covid I don&#39;t think politics has anything to do with a virus someone tells me to vaccinated to save my family  I will why is it so hard or wearing a mask so that I don&#39;t infect people I love I don&#39;t see the harm in covering your face to stop the  spread of gems u cover your mouth when u sneeze so what&#39;s the problem
2021-08-13T20:59:14Z,When I was a child the big vaccine was for polio. Dr. Salk&#39;s vaccine was a medical break through - saving countless American children from a terrible crippling disease. Every child in school got vaccinated. But that was back then. Today there is something going on which is beyond being just plain stupid - right wing reactionary yahoos who subscribe to off the wall conspiracy theories are taking over the South land. I afraid Governor DeSantis is a member of this group of demented souls.
2021-08-13T20:58:56Z,I&#39;m sure this scab has some accusations out there. Come forward <br>people so he can resign.
2021-08-13T20:58:00Z,Steven King part - time snowbunny from Mainesaid he&#39;s not the brightest bulb in the chandelier. He let a toxic liquid impoundment deteriorate; let it  flow into Tampa Bay now red tide and dead fish on the shore. Paul Krugman estimates 15% decline in economy. <br>Norwegian Cruise Lines won in court on fax certification. John D.<br>Macdonald is spinning in his grave.
2021-08-13T20:56:30Z,So glad we sold and left. Governor Goober unbelievable!
2021-08-13T20:55:35Z,"Yep, mini me li&#39;l man trump."
2021-08-13T20:53:39Z,170+ children hospitalised??? That is an outrage! It is also against the Florida Constitution.
2021-08-13T20:50:16Z,"The mini mango moron seems to forget trump lost, impeached twice, lost house and senate."
2021-08-13T20:48:14Z,That Gov  is all about the Money Money 🪰🪰🪰🪰🤡🤡🤡🤡🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾🤮🤮🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🤡🤡🤡💰💰👀👀👀👀👀💰💰👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿
2021-08-13T20:47:03Z,And Trump was just a mini Roy Cohn.
2021-08-13T20:44:52Z,The percentage of vaccinated persons is about the same in Florida and Portugal. Why are the hospitals in Florida in such terrible chaos?
2021-08-13T20:43:36Z,Maybe!!! Medical insurance companies should send out forms and ask if they are getting the vaccine!! Or record a call. Deny them coverage if they get the virus!! Payment...not care. Stupidity has a price!! Death!!
2021-08-13T20:42:58Z,"Remember that time MSNBC called Cuomo &quot;the gold standard of leadership?!?&quot; Remember that time MSNBC called Michael Avannatti &quot;the future of america?!?&quot; Remember that time MSNBC said &quot;the Hunter laptop is Russian disinformation?!?&quot; Lol, if you still watch and believe MSNBC, youre just desperate and suffering from TDS"
2021-08-13T20:42:32Z,"Interesting, I live in central FL. Cases are up a lot but deaths are not. Hospitals in my big city area are not over run. Why pick on a governor that is respecting the freedom of the people to make their own choices. If someone doesn’t want to get vaccinated then let them take the risk of dying. That’s on them. I believe in vaccines but I don’t believe in forcing them. If we force this vaccine then why don’t we force the flu vaccine. They are designed to work the same way. Doesn’t prevent contraction or spread, just reduces symptoms and protects the individual from hospitalization or death."
2021-08-13T20:42:23Z,DeSantis is awesome!!!
2021-08-13T20:39:15Z,Well the &quot;vaccinated&quot; Governor can only continue to &quot;lead&quot; if Florida residents allow it to continue. Its on them.
2021-08-13T20:37:40Z,I hereby challenge all republicans to go a month without using the word &quot;freedom&quot; . Let&#39;s see how those red loving republicans go....
2021-08-13T20:36:27Z,"Chipola College, you know that highly accredited school of higher learning. That is where mini trump chooses to try an elevate his argument to a more  erudite level. This is where Desantis says a sentence where he references &quot;things&quot; multiple times to denote specific items. Dumb da dum dum Dumbbbbbbb."
2021-08-13T20:35:44Z,"That goof wants a free society , cancel ALL laws ."
2021-08-13T20:35:31Z,Minnie Trump go to bed
2021-08-13T20:35:11Z,And Killing young Children Young Adults&#39; and Adults over his Pandemic laws all these governors are OPEN SEASON Lives Matter Mr DeSANTIS and they will get rid of you
2021-08-13T20:34:44Z,Desantis claiming southern border open and people from around the world coming in ? What a goof .
2021-08-13T20:34:00Z,"What Don the Con and Deathsantis must be telling themselves: &quot;Let&#39;s keep doubling down on our lies, and eventually people will give up and follow us as we become dictators.&quot;<br><br>No, we have seen you, for the petulant children-men you are."
2021-08-13T20:33:49Z,Thank god florida isnt locked down.  The virus isnt as bad as the hospitals that treats it.
2021-08-13T20:32:43Z,Why is it never mentioned that the obvious motivation for republican resistance to covid guidance is to have it out of control again to weaken the Biden presidency. They (republicans) are killing people for politics.
2021-08-13T20:32:40Z,Does that mean sending back all the Cubans that come to Florida or are they different from other&#39;s
2021-08-13T20:31:43Z,"Wow, the Republicans really don&#39;t  care if any of us die."
2021-08-13T20:31:41Z,"FLORIDA IF YOU ARE LISTENING  VOTE OUT DESANTIS ON NOVEMBER 8th,  2022!!"
2021-08-13T20:30:17Z,I&#39;d bet anyone.. Desantis AND his family are vaccinated.
2021-08-13T20:29:47Z,The saddest thing going on is that right wing voters have been swallowing all of this crap the new fascist party have been spoon feeding them is that they are willing to risk their parents and even their own children to a virous they won&#39;t acknowledge or even admit exists.  Now the governor in florida wants to stop funding to education professionals who are willing to do whatever it takes to protect their children in the classroom.  The most disgusting of all is the people who support this creature.
2021-08-13T20:29:46Z,"As the anti-vaxxers die off, the positive test rates will go down and DeSantos can claim a victory!    Giving them help is a waste of medical supplies as De Santos will likely sell them to Texas"
2021-08-13T20:29:31Z,A Fox News hero!
2021-08-13T20:26:51Z,DeSantis has no kids in public schools.  Kids don&#39;t vote.  He can lose them.
2021-08-13T20:26:02Z,To Endanger the Lives of the very People that You were Elected to Protect in serve. The Pursuit of the next rug of the Political Ladder
2021-08-13T20:25:04Z,why is this not called manslaughter by criminal negligence ??   Killing hundreds of people for what?  A run against another Sociopath?
2021-08-13T20:22:33Z,Recall this pos.
2021-08-13T20:19:54Z,If Desantis gets sick the hospitals should refuse to treat him. All of the people dying in Florida are on Desantis’ hands and their family members should go stand in front of his house with pictures of the loved one they lost. He needs to see what he is doing.
2021-08-13T20:17:22Z,"Ron DeSantis will let the people in Florida die, rather than admit he’s wrong. And he is wrong. The most child Covid cases proves it. <br><br>Ron…you really are killing your state. And why? Is a shrinking Trump base worth it? Are the children of Florida worth it? The path you are on will not lead you to the White House."
2021-08-13T20:16:33Z,the republican party should be called the pro death party because they are killing there own base through COVID conspiracy theories.
2021-08-13T20:15:48Z,"Over half million Americans died due to Covid19, miss information and failure of political leadership of Republican Party. Who am I to argue if this people chose the rout of death not freedom."
2021-08-13T20:14:29Z,"here&#39;s a question: if you are a politician promoting legislation that kills massive numbers of people, are you guilty of mass murder and as such, are you guilty of war crimes?"
2021-08-13T20:14:28Z,"When we spoke of the con man and Thief cokehead we still called him President Trump, I expect you to do the same for President Biden, don&#39;t call them Joe Biden. Call him president Biden."
2021-08-13T20:13:18Z,Not into the ground but more like 6ft down. 💀
2021-08-13T20:06:17Z,Mini Trump should be locked up for gross negligence and manslaughter.
2021-08-13T20:04:04Z,DeSantis is playing politics so he won&#39;t lose votes in his next election.
2021-08-13T20:04:03Z,I’m in Florida I currently know eight people with Covid and I’m not even a very social person. I find out about someone new with Covid every day sometimes two in one day. It is terrifying here. Summer vaccinated so much the ones that aren’t vaccinated or obviously sicker. I’m scared of the next Variant happening here
2021-08-13T20:02:39Z,Anything like whT Biden is doing to the country....POS&#39;s
2021-08-13T20:02:27Z,Pretty telling misinformation and lies begin by teaching your children to believe the lies. That is why these magarats are so fierce in their belief they have been fed it from birth. They will die for it.
2021-08-13T20:01:45Z,"If he is voted out when the time comes, great. If he remains then republicans will get what they deserve. The kids deserve better than this."

2021-08-13T19:59:08Z,Republicans party are complicit and still trying to hold Americans down!
2021-08-13T19:57:55Z,Wait until an ant-vaxxers kid dies!
2021-08-13T19:57:43Z,"Well, if he is doubling down on vaccinations and masks, the next person that dies because of his stupidity, their family should go to the police and have him charged with murder"

2021-08-13T19:52:34Z,DiSantis is vaccinated so his base shouldn’t be listening to this hypocrite.
2021-08-13T19:52:32Z,Ron DeSantis is the kind of guy that buys more bilge pumps to stop a boat from sinking instead of fixing the leak.
2021-08-13T19:50:57Z,Being dumb has become a requirement for being a Republican.
2021-08-13T19:48:59Z,"Anti vaxxer&#39;s in Florida, by far the most of them being Republican.  Love to tell me that only 3% die from Covid. So why bother.  The population of the State of Florida is  21.48  million souls. 3% alone does not sound like anything to worry about.  But the keyword there is <b>percent</b>  3% of Florida&#39;s population is <b>Six Hundred Thousand Four Hundred Souls.</b>  And that is most certainly enough to change an election base. Ron DeSantis is single handily helping to turn the state of Florida Blue."
2021-08-13T19:47:16Z,Please tell me how DeSantis’ opposition to masks and vaccines helps him win elections! Are Republican voters that stupid and suicidal? They want Dr. Faulchi jailed for saving lives.
2021-08-13T19:47:01Z,Covid is killing Republicans by the thousands. <br>Trump is emptying Republican bank accounts by the millions.<br>That party does not have long to live.

2021-08-13T19:34:06Z,"Grow up and sober up, Governor.  Your comments are in bad taste."
2021-08-13T19:31:57Z,"He&#39;s like Obama, it&#39;s called being &quot;Sophisticated&quot;. Report on both sides of the party not only against yours. Your Bias is showing!!!"
2021-08-13T19:27:37Z,Did we just forget that this virus has a death rate of under 1% and the vulnerable have already been vaccinated?
2021-08-13T19:27:24Z,"No, you let COVID single out Florida"

2021-08-13T19:46:26Z,Maybe if you stopped spreading BS like this cases would go down too :-)
2021-08-13T19:22:53Z,The guy is an elected mass murderer and people in Florida will keep on electing this type of persons. It says a lot of the population of Florida.

2021-08-13T19:17:48Z,I guess they can take their freedoms to the grave. It&#39;s sad because everyone who can get the vaccine are putting all those who can&#39;t get the vaccine at risk.

2021-08-13T19:07:42Z,"MAGA doesn’t care if you die from Covid. Prove your loyalty. Just like the Vietnam War we were all for it until the body count included friends or family. Not masking or vaccinating shows your loyalty to the cause even if your spreading the disease. 625,000 and counting.America is number one in global Covid deaths."

2021-08-13T19:01:12Z,DeSantis I gather he is in his second term so there&#39;s no voting him out However I think we can rule out him becoming POTUS. He is being totally irresponsible. People will change their minds about him as time goes by. To put kids at risk will not help him.
2021-08-13T22:14:40Z,"No, this is his first term.  Hope he gets voted OUT."

2021-08-13T18:32:39Z,Don’t vote for him next election. A man who would let children die should NOT be in power. He should actually be convicted and sent to prison for killing those that rely on him as a leader. He is NO leader.
2021-08-13T18:32:26Z,As bad or worst as Trump!

2021-08-14T01:17:35Z,He requested ventilators from the feds. So there’s that.
2021-08-14T22:05:18Z,He says until President Biden does something about the southern borders don&#39;t tell him about Florida and he doesn&#39;t want to here anything about the Covid-19 He said this on tv to the world to see he is just passing his failure at stopping this virus on the southern borders and before that it was china&#39;s fault let&#39;s wait to see who he will blame in the next week when there&#39;s no ICU beds or room for the regular sick people because covid will have over flooded the hospital 😬

2021-08-13T17:05:22Z,"Smokers want freedom to choose where they can light up, Don&#39;t stop just at freedom from masks Governor!"
2021-08-14T15:36:51Z,And he should ban traffic lights. People should be able to choose when they cross intersections
2021-08-13T17:02:06Z,The blood of Floridians will be on his hands.
2021-08-13T17:00:29Z,Telling a Republican to grow up..... good luck with that.
2021-08-13T17:00:07Z,(T)Turncoat (R)Republicans (U)Undermine (M)Medical (P)Procedures…..That’s what those republicans against DeSantis’s ridiculous Civid-19 policies should print on hats and beer cozies! Democrats probably would even wear and buy those items and the money could go towards court costs for those groups suing DeSantis! Just a thought.
2021-08-13T16:59:05Z,Does anyone remember the young man on spring break last year who said that he was healthy and wouldn&#39;t get the virus? And then got it and was brave enough to admit that he was wrong. I don&#39;t recall if that was in Florida.
2021-08-14T22:46:10Z,I remember but I don&#39;t remember which state
2021-08-13T16:56:02Z,What do you want to bet that Desantis has gotten his vaccination. Bet he was first in line!
2021-08-13T16:55:29Z,I blame trump again.<br>He started this cesspool of backward logic and blatant lies.

2021-08-13T16:55:08Z,Desantis is killing innocent people because of his lying tactics he learned from trump

2021-08-13T16:38:21Z,americans shouldn&#39;t send anything to this state. maybe if they are left to their own devices they will see how idiotic this guy really is. if they want to die for him then so be it.
2021-08-13T16:34:30Z,DeSantis is on the wrong side of history. He’s killing his own constituents.
2021-08-13T23:43:07Z,Maria: All Republicans who Support Trump Are doing that! Why is that a Shock!

2021-08-13T16:31:58Z,We’re not closing Florida so THANK YOU Desantis!
2021-08-13T16:31:06Z,When will CNN and MSNBC realize that DeSantis is using your network to advertise. They don&#39;t care that you are reporting on their stupid remarks and racist policies. It plays directly into their campaign strategy. Do you really think your reporting is going to change anyones mind?
2021-08-13T16:27:02Z,"When people willingly drink the coolaid based on what a leader says and end up literally dead, we&#39;re pretty certain (understatement) that we&#39;re dealing with a cult."

2021-08-13T16:26:51Z,How is this man not in jail for endangering so many Floridians?
2021-08-13T16:17:52Z,He doesn’t care about the Floridians.  Your people are dieing.  Get the shot people and be safe and mask up again.  We have been advised not to travel to Florida and all states with higher rates of virus.
2021-08-13T16:16:29Z,"Total Lie, political propaganda for money. Florida is actually doing a great job staying open and dealing with the virus. Just today they started sending out antibody treatment teams to treat at home so as not to need a hospital. No one else is so innovative. These people on MSNBC are just trying to divide us so they can make money off of the conflict they create. Hope and pray for everyone to see the light and do the right things for everyone not just themselves. My opinion"

2021-08-13T16:14:42Z,Hitler?
2021-08-13T16:13:46Z,DeSantis &quot; His know it all attitude &quot; and his complete &quot; Mental Denial &quot; of the Pandemic costs lives.
2021-08-13T16:12:35Z,"I don’t think anyone at this point, can explain it better than YOU!!!"
2021-08-13T16:11:04Z,Even his hand gestures are like Trump!  Wow.
2021-08-13T16:10:46Z,Desantits and his Trump followers are very ignorant or just plain stupid. It is interesting how people that are against vaccines wearing mask etc when they actually get covid state do not be stupid get vaccinated because they themselves are very sick or near death because of their prior decisions.
2021-08-13T16:10:44Z,"DeSantis is funding raising on this, while people and children are dying. He has earned more than $18 millions. recently on this optic."
2021-08-13T16:09:06Z,"DeSantis has clearly demonstrated himself as a true American, &quot;Everyone else is to blame for my ignorance and failure.&quot;<br>I hear he is staring in a new version of the &quot;Wizard of Cause&quot; he will be playing the part of the &quot;Tin Lion&quot;...<br>Not only does the character not have a brain, but also has no heart. Perhaps when it&#39;s all done and over, should that for obvious reasons, 99% of those who died related to covid will be of his party and supporters. This will certainly leave a lot more Breathing Room in Florida. I only recently started feeling this way, mainly because I am tired of trying to educate, dispel untruths and provide rational deductive reasoning against ridiculous conspiracy theories about the pandemic."
2021-08-13T22:27:57Z,"I am with you on this. There will most certainly be fewer Republican votes in the next election. They blame illegals, but it&#39;s the Trump supporter next door with the Trump 2020 bumper sticker spreading the virus around because they listened to an idiotic president/governor rather than the health experts. It&#39;s no one&#39;s fault but their own and quite frankly, they deserve it."
2021-08-13T16:09:00Z,"Can DeSantis be liable and able to sue, for deaths, illness damage, high medical bills incurred by his own mandates and orders to ban mandates of COVID mitigation actions? How many children have to die? Who is paying for these funerals and medical bills????"
2021-08-13T16:05:35Z,"Desantis is a stupid man. We are trying to save his voters, and he&#39;s helping get rid of them. Now to me he cutting his own throat.But when it comes to the children he needs to be locked up."
2021-08-13T16:04:58Z,I know this putz it talking but all I hear is this low BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!
2021-08-13T16:03:07Z,don’t florida my america.
2021-08-13T16:02:35Z,The are not pro choice mask wearing. They are anti masks and anti science.
2021-08-13T16:02:04Z,"DeSantis says he is leaving parents to make decisions on masks. Yesterday in Local news, interviewing families at school board building, every parent said they are leaving it up to their child. THESE WERE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN!!!!"
2021-08-13T15:59:45Z,So that&#39;s why so many people are moving there?
2021-08-13T15:59:24Z,other states in usa should put &quot;must have vaccination who coming from florida and texas&quot;. so other state&#39;s people dont die
2021-08-13T15:59:08Z,"DESANTIS IS PUSHING MONOCLONAL TREATMENT NOW, BUT!!! He is still condemning and banning mandates on vaccinations &amp; masks!!! Hospital bills will be killing families and futures!"
2021-08-13T15:59:08Z,Love ur face by the way.
2021-08-13T15:58:27Z,Do they remember polio  how ignorant are they you all saw what Trump&#39;s done he was in Sarasota and now virus back.his followers proud of taking over Sarasota. Wow mental. Think President should be allowed more power in medical situation
2021-08-13T15:57:54Z,"The only &quot;expert&quot; DeSantis cares about is a fat, narcisisst draft dodger.  Interesting that DeSantis brings up the hunting down of Ossama Bin Laden. By Obama. After Bush literally said he didn&#39;t care if we ever took him down."

2021-08-13T15:56:15Z,Those who follow the stupid Governor deserve to suffer and die. I will not accept those idiots as fellow citizens if they are acting like this.
2021-08-13T15:55:53Z,lol this is such a lie from you evil creatures....the three big blue states are ruined by the governors and the mayors of their large cities.... just look at them...look what states people are moving to.... guess what they sure are not blue states....pathetic story but what else should be expected from you creatures
2021-08-13T15:55:21Z,"Simply, Republicans Floridian is being massacred because of the stupidity anti-vaccination ideology and DeSantis is the leader in chief."
2021-08-13T15:55:15Z,don&#39;t forget desantis was responsible for the environmental disaster of Port Manatee.

The masks are worthless!!! How many people are dying from the vaccine? I don&#39;t believe the Media and I don&#39;t trust the government! No one holds the media accountable!

2021-08-13T15:47:36Z,"And then Floridians travel, not yet knowing they have the delta variant, keeping the pandemic going strong."
2021-08-13T15:47:23Z,"I just don’t understand how this man could be so evil. What is he looking for the murdering of more people people who trusted him to take care of them? I hope they don’t listen to him he’s just trying to impress Trump and he doesn’t care how many lives will be lost. You need to get your shot you don’t want to have a ventilator put down your throat so you could breathe just because you did not get a shot don’t listen to this man. Take care of your kid! Take care of your family, please get your shot this man is wrong."
2021-08-13T15:46:41Z,"Haven&#39;t been to NY or CA lately?   In California, you can poop in the streets, use drugs in public, walk into any store and take whatever you want under $1,000 without paying for it, and no ID needed to vote..........BUT you must show that you are vaccinated/healthy or risk using your job......and both states run by governors in the process of being replaced."
2021-08-13T15:46:27Z,America is the biggest country where Litigation is concerned; you&#39;d think those who fall victim to COVID in Florida; would hold him liable for spreading his false narratives about the pandemic? They have to know that it is all politically motivated by now !
2021-08-13T15:46:08Z,DeSantis is a threat to Floridians. Put him out of office.
2021-08-13T15:45:33Z,This man should be impeached. Cuomo is being impeached in New York. While Ron Desantis is killing people. So tell me what is worse. Killing people or touching a boob.
2021-08-13T15:45:31Z,He even try to Talk with his hands like the Donald Rump.
2021-08-13T15:44:40Z,People should start suing him for putting their health and lives at risk...

2021-08-13T15:37:20Z,"If people refuse to get vaccinated then don&#39;t allow them into the hospitals. Let their family, church members and unvaccinated friends take turns nursing them. If they die, too bad, so sad."

2021-08-13T15:26:13Z,Ari you got to understand Florida gets too much sun enough to get some people&#39;s brain fried. Hurricanes don&#39;t get there fast enough to cool them off. That is where the stupidity of Desantis comes from.
2021-08-13T15:25:28Z,"De Santis is more like a comical Mussolini as he tries to outdo Trump in anti-viral rhetoric.  He is a little man who was given big boots that he has no ability to fill.  Floridans, put this rascal out to pasture in 2022."
2021-08-13T15:23:44Z,"I fully expect him to refuse to leave office when he is voted out next year, just to complete his Trump impersonation."

How many hours per year do you spend waiting for traffic lights to turn green? Hos much time, over the last year and a half putting a mask on or taking it off. And you can do that while you are walking, so really, it&#39;s not a total loss time wise. Not like res lights are.<br>    You see a red light and you have to come to a stop, making no progress at all towards your destination until the light turns green. Even then, you have to look before you proceed incase someone is going to not wait for <b>HIS</b> red light.<br>    BTW If you don&#39;t do this, you really should. It&#39;s saved me from having an accident so many times in my 36 years of driving. Once it even saved me when a 18-wheeler busted a light, and I think he was going way over the limit when he crossed in front of me."

The world is slowly dying anyway. No amount of protest in the world is gonna stop those powerful enough to control it. And violence would only lead to more violence. The war was already over when the election became final. That&#39;s why i took the vaccine. Its better to get what you want from the inside than to fight directly from the outside

Our goal was initially to &quot;flatten the curve&quot; so that we weren&#39;t all hit at once.

2021-08-13T13:07:49Z,"Delta variant is affecting kids more and making them more seriously ill. So, the Governor of Florida is literally willing to allow kids to become seriously ill. Even if you exclude everything else, this fact is just sickening. Impeach the governor and fast!"

We can not even help ourselves so we can not help you,  and now we have a crisis on a cruise ship that just sailed and is full of covid. EVERY DAY is somethinng else tragic.

Ya know, many years ago Rush Limbaugh said when Obama was President that he didn&#39;t believe in how he wanted to run the country, and he hoped Obama failed.  At the time I was against that thinking.  Now...he was right.  I hope that DeSantis fails in how he is running Florida (and I live here!).  If he and the people (mainly Trumpers) want to risk their lives - then they will reap the consequences.  They pass laws to restrict votes - well, death sure restricts votes, and Trumpers who die of covid sure can&#39;t vote.  I&#39;ll just avoid crowds, wear a mask when I go out, wash my hands, etc (and I&#39;m proudly fully vaccinated) and wait for these idiots to just die off due to their own ignorance and stupidity."

In November 2020,  Pfizer applied for emergency authorisation based on their findings of 95 % prevention.of the disease. Now just 9 months later they say the vaccine makes you less sick. To go from prevention to less sick is a massive shift. So far 200 million have caught the disease an only 2% have died. Therefore our own immune system is 98% effective.  Shut up  MSNBC."

2021-08-13T11:41:13Z,What about the right of parents <i>to keep their children healthy?</i><br>DeSantis better be careful. Pretty soon there won&#39;t be enough of his  &#39;followers&#39; left alive to elect him President. There might not even be enough left alive to re-elect him Governor.
2021-08-13T23:40:51Z,They can put masks on their children if they want to. They have a choice.
2021-08-14T22:19:23Z,Exactly he too busy blaming others for his failure with the handling of this virus his own voters will be affected by this Delta virus he doesn&#39;t think about that he&#39;s a train Wreck to his own supporters
2021-08-13T11:40:36Z,DeSantis really screwed it up fast ..The tallahassee reaper lol

2021-08-13T11:03:11Z,"Cowboys WORE FACE COVERINGS- called BANDANAS ….<br><br>Here is a bit of YOUR HISTORY AMERICA 🇺🇸 <br><br>Clay Reynolds university of Texas 1971 wrote … on use of bandanas - including as face coverings <br><br>A neckerchief has a dual origin. In part, they were worn as a substitute for a necktie, or cravat, the fashion for which had evolved in the nineteenth century as fashions changed. The were developed in the eighteenth century and were not used as handkerchiefs, which had entirely different functions in society and also sometimes in work.<br><br>The function of the cravat was practical, though; it kept the neck warm and, in more formal attire, concealed the buttons that held the collar onto the shirt—generally two, one in front and one in back, depending on the fashion of a particular period. Knotting cravats was elaborate and often difficult to do, but they were more or less required, and all classes of people wore them.<br><br>The herdsman’s neckerchief had more elaborate functions and less elaborate knotting procedures. Often made of gingham or some other brightly colored material, they were larger than a formal cravat and generally were square as opposed to being longer and more narrow in structure, depending on the fashion in formal attire at the moment. Working herders, or cowboys as they later would come to be called, did not generally wear collars on their shirts, and soft-collared shirts didn’t come into fashion until late in the nineteenth century. Shirts often buttoned down the front or pulled over the head and had crew collars, or they might have buttoned up to the throat. (Today’s baseball uniform is a close approximation of that kind of shirt.) The neckerchief was designed to fit around the neck. In hot weather, they could be folded in a broader fashion and worn either around the back of the neck to ward off sunburn, or they might be pulled across the face and knotted behind the head if a herder was working in a dusty area.<br><br>They had other functions, as well. They could be dampened and worn as a cooling device around the throat or on the back of the neck; as most were made of bright colors—red was highly favored—they could be used as a flag; they could be loosened and waved in front of a charging or out of control animal as a distraction; and, of course, they could be used to bind wounds or staunch bleeding or as a wash cloth for cleaning or a towel for drying off. They could also double as handkerchiefs, at least in a pinch. Neckerchiefs of the period tended to be quite large, somewhere around 24″ square or larger, and how they were folded would depend on how they were to be used.<br><br>Western herdsmen did not wear bandannas or neckerchiefs as a fashionable display, as a rule. If they “dressed up,” they would more likely don a cravat or a necktie, with a collar, waistcoat and frock coat, all worn over a blousey cotton or wool shirt that was worn over a full set of long underwear. Long underwear was worn year-round. If one was prosperous enough, he might have more than one pair—cotton for summer, wool for winter—but he rarely removed them, even to bathe. If he was lucky enough to get a bath, he most likely immersed himself while wearing them, thereby combining a laundering chore with a personal bath. Apart from reducing chafing, long underwear had the added advantage of providing a layer of fabric to retain warmth, or they would hold moisture from perspiration and provide a cooling effect in summer.<br><br>Livestock herdsmen were not exclusive in their use of the bandanna or kerchief. Railroad workers also adopted them and wore them in much the same way and for many of the same reasons, and no trainsman would have thought of going to work without one. Loggers used them, as did other laborers and workmen in various occupations. The provision of a kerchief in one’s pocket was as essential as a good pocket watch or pocket knife; they just didn’t leave home with out them.<br><br>You didn’t ask, but a word might be said about socks, which were highly prized on the frontier. Again cotton was preferred for summer; wool for winter. But they wore out quickly and needed darning and mending constantly. They had no elastic properties and were held up by garters that were worn high on the shin. When they finally denigrated from wear and tear, the herdsman would have to do without until he came to a haberdasher or dry-goods store with enough money in his pocket to replenish his supply. One of the most valued items a frontiersman or soldier could receive in the mail “from back home” was a pair of socks."

2021-08-13T10:41:49Z,"If Covid stopped at borders, I’d say good riddance,  But it doesn’t and current and future victims are the collateral damage in DeSantis’s sick and quixotic campaign."
2021-08-13T10:37:16Z,"The Governor of Florida, over played his hand. People will realize he has poor leadership. He only wants to look good for the Trump cult. The Governor of Florida is disgusting 😑."
2021-08-13T19:47:31Z,That sums it up well.
2021-08-13T10:34:18Z,Liesssss!!!!!!!!!!

2021-08-13T10:25:59Z,"DeSantis is so worried about the impact on the economy because of COVID lockdowns and mask mandates. Well, I was planning on coming to Florida for a month in the fall to visit friends and relatives spending a lot of my retirement money in the state. But Florida is such a mess because of DeSantis&#39;s mismanagement of COVID I&#39;ve decided Florida is not a same place to be. I&#39;ve cancelled my trip. I wonder how much money Florida will lose because of DeSantis&#39;s idiocy?"
2021-08-13T10:25:34Z,This governor is yet to be infected and it&#39;s the Dems fault 🤣
2021-08-13T10:21:05Z,The Florida people still love him. He has a cult like Trump and it unfortunately works. He’s running for President.
2021-08-13T10:19:11Z,"This RW jerk is trying to out Trump Trump. Apparently killing off your citizens is his path to the WH, go figure. How is this small government working for FL when he is running around blocking schools &amp; business from taking precautions???"

2021-08-13T10:04:59Z,DeSatanist is going to let Florida burn literally with his stance on man made climate change and now killing people with his Covid policy
2021-08-13T09:56:23Z,Republicans are good at destroying everything
2021-08-13T09:56:09Z,"It’s hard to comprehend how people like Desantis, Trump, Taylor-Green and others like them, think. Or do they?"
2021-08-13T09:55:10Z,Just be comforted by the fact that all those snowbirds will be leaving Flordia soon and will be bringing this back to your state soon.
2021-08-13T09:52:13Z,Dam the communist left is terrified of this former Naval Officer . Im suprised the attacks against him didnt start earlier.  But this show has almost no viewership so who gives a fk really . Matter of fact even MAD- COWs ratings have tanked
2021-08-13T09:51:24Z,Florida and Texas are ravaged by covid and both governor&#39;s are trying their hardest to evidently spread the virus. I guess old white guys would rather watch everyone die then be told what to do. The Republican way!
2021-08-13T09:41:51Z,George Washington would have executed most of the elected republicans like this vile faux human being. So you thumbs down to this video“humans” might want to remember that. You never know when a true patriot will rise again.
2021-08-13T09:34:40Z,"Thank Trump for exposing America to the world as the country with the dumbest people in the world, especially their leaders."
2021-08-13T09:33:21Z,Look don&#39;t blame him<br> Blame the people who voted for him....
2021-08-13T09:32:36Z,DeSantis is even too stupid to put on a mask the right way .... so what do you expect ...
2021-08-13T09:32:03Z,"Is it me, or DeSantis have the same teeny, tiny little hands as Trump?<br>On a serious note - he and Abbott are being right little fascists about Covid precautions."
2021-08-13T09:31:19Z,"&quot;Florida leads the country in pediatric hospitalizations of children&#39; with covid&quot; these idiots need to take politics out of this!  If and when these idiots (who don&#39;t want to get vaccinated ) catch covid, THEY SHOULD NOT Be allowed to go to the hospital! The hospitals are almost at capacity with non vaccinated people, who caught covid.  They need to save the beds for people that actually need them for other life threatening Issues like, heart attacks, strokes, etc!  This has nothing to do with politics at all!  This is a pandemic This is about saving lives And by taking the vaccine  Hospitalization is 99.9% preventable!!"

2021-08-14T01:22:37Z,"It&#39;s low hanging fruit to claim the only people who die from stupidity are the stupid, but that is not reality. The stupid are infecting everyone around them, regardless of intelligence, and smart people die from COVID just as easily. I understand the sentiment you&#39;ve tried to convey, but it is extremely erroneous to claim everyone dying from COVID does so because they deserve it."
2021-08-14T08:39:26Z,@@EclecticFruit well the percentage dying right now is 99.8% or something. So yes the 0.2% definitely doesn’t deserve it.

I realize that whatever she was laughing about was surely unrelated but it gave off a foul odor considering how important it is to get through to all the genetic defectives about how serious Covid is and how insanely important it is to wear masks and to get vaccinated. The interviewee trying to put across very sober and realistic information is unintentionally mocked by laughter from medical professionals in the background in real time."
2021-08-13T07:20:38Z,Foul odor for RON DE SANTIS...MEDICAL PEOPLE ARE LIKE HUMANS AND THEY LAUGH!!!
2021-08-13T06:15:54Z,Desantis expertise is what brought them to this point. Ugh. He needs to go on a long walk.

2021-08-13T05:26:12Z,"The trouble is too many people in Florida only listen to so called &quot;News&quot; stations that don&#39;t deliver news -- only far right wing propaganda, lies and conspiracy theories. Biden supposedly lost Florida because a large portion of people in the state believed the made up story that Biden was a socialist. Honestly, if you actually believe Biden is a socialist, you&#39;ll believe anything -- including apparently all the b.s. and misinformation dished out by Fox &quot;News&quot; and others like them about the pandemic."
2021-08-13T05:20:45Z,It&#39;s similar to them saying my body my choice while trying to tell women what they can do with theirs. The irony.

2021-08-13T05:16:47Z,"People making masks and covid political should be ashamed. I fear living in a world where no one listens to medical professionals, gets vaccinated, and uses Facebook, reddit and Twitter to get their health information and advice. We would be riddled with diseases just like the 3rd world countries who can&#39;t afford vaccines. If you needed surgery would you take the advice of a surgeon or a politician? If you had cancer would you get your health advice from facebook or reddit? If wearing a mask saves at least ONE person&#39;s life would that not make it worth it or are we too far gone to even lack basic empathy for others? What happens when the next pandemic it&#39;s much worse with %80 mortality rate and much more infectious and dangerous to Everyone? With no one trusting MEDICAL professionals and science there would be no hope for mankind. It&#39;s not about your personal freedom right now. It&#39;s a health emergency and it&#39;s about the health and well being of EVERYONE."

2021-08-13T04:47:17Z,Right… how about reporting how CDC cooked the numbers to support their narrative
2021-08-13T04:42:41Z,a lot of politicians (trump on top of the list) have contributed to the rise in death tolls from COVID in the US with bad policies and misinformation. It&#39;s just amazing how it is possible to get away with all of that with no accountability.
2021-08-13T04:11:25Z,We’re doing just fine here I’m Florida I’ll have you know.   Quit causing more stress and division…   Divide and conquer is so yesterday.   Too many of us are onto that tactic and it’s really annoying.

2021-08-13T04:06:09Z,I don&#39;t see him as a mini trump. Trump was simply too much of a coward to speak against policies his base is opposed to. I don&#39;t think he would actively fight local gov like this
2021-08-13T03:55:50Z,I don&#39;t know this governor from a bar of soap.<br>I did have a quick look at Google for the relevant statistics Florida is sitting about the middle of the pack when it comes to deaths.<br>The death rate has also been on a downward trend over the last year.<br>In fact looking at the statistics when compared to new York Florida had more cases and less deaths.<br><br>This is looking more like a hit peace to me gota love you American&#39;s crazy bunch.

2021-08-13T03:19:49Z,"So these people are against lock down, they don&#39;t want mask mandate, and they don&#39;t believe in vaccine.  So what&#39;s the strategy, just pretend Covid doesn&#39;t exist?  And just pretend hospitals are not overwhelmed?"
2021-08-13T03:15:04Z,BEST ... GOVERNER...IN .... THE ... US.  it&#39;s not his fault Biden shipped covid positive people all over the US.
2021-08-13T03:08:13Z,"Does anyone understand that Florida is still like 26th in the nation in deaths as they have been even though as the third most populous state the infections are bound to rise in a spike situation. MSNBC has lost their cash cow in Trump and with ratings down, are grasping for this kind of terrible reporting. Do we really care if cases of the cold, flu, or covid are up if deaths are not? DeSantis has the difficult task of applying the ever changing “science” to formulate policy and in some cases when the science is reversing itself. The simple bottom line is just as DeSantis says, wear masks if you want to and get the shot, but government in Florida will not mandate. How can we here in Florida take these naysayers seriously when we keep catching them violating their own mandates constantly. I will be ecstatic when Covid loses top billing in the news so that they can move to the next fear driven accusations. Remember Florida mirrored the rest of the country when NY for example was getting slaughtered and they made Cuomo a saint, therefore Florida adjusted their policies and took care of the old first. Over 80% of that group are fully vaccinated."

2021-08-13T00:53:37Z,Yeah DeSantis doesn&#39;t want to admit that he&#39;s a bonehead and when he said there&#39;s no need for masks that&#39;s why the cases are jumping sky high and through the roof and then he tries to blame Joe Biden of course because Joe Biden is all about wearing masks so how does that work? And thanks people in Florida for giving us Rick DeSantis he&#39;s only trying to grow the virus like cartels are trying to grow marijuana fields except the cartels don&#39;t blame American customers for buying too much because they can&#39;t keep up with the demand LMAO

If everyone goes back into ancient times with the taxes even tho  Taxes never stop;- but it is becoming more of a stress on almost every little thing and then the fees on top of it.  So all the money you make and made is being stolen from you.  Now the federal government can stop giving out money - then the people go dumbfounded.  So what would you rather be?  dumb - turn the other cheek and slave to this empire of this corporation of taxes until finally you wake up and realize there is no way of getting out of taxes and fees, this is your dream or become of the individual person you are and trade according to the situation. like having most control of your investments and have that dream."

He’s making all the same type of mistakes with other people’s lives just as Trump did, and the rest of the Republican Party. Don’t any governors or other state and elected officials have to prove they have at least one foot firmly planted in reality? Don’t they have to prove they can follow the logic of an argument, speak intelligently about subject matter they have to deal with on a daily basis, understand that just even having a modicum of interest in basic history would be an advantage in taking on these political positions and, not least, realize the importance of at least thumbing through the constitution, just so they can say they do know it exists???"

2021-08-12T23:01:00Z,why does he want people and kids to die? Is that not a criminal offense?
2021-08-12T22:59:55Z,"What is the right wing disinformation?  You don’t like what’s happening in Florida , vacancy’s in New York. You are making this issue a partisan issue.  Is inflation important for the those left living ?  Why is Florida so important now oh you need to keep your job . You make me 🤮🤮🤣🤣"
2021-08-12T22:59:49Z,I was sickened when I saw him with (I assume) is his child. Surely he must be responsible for child abuse for bringing them up with lies ?

2021-08-12T22:54:28Z,"good for business governor DeSantis?   who in their right mind would ever set up an event in your state now or in the near future?  You’re a horrible businessman and governor, you’re driving your state bankrupt."
2021-08-12T22:53:50Z,Ron should learn from failure of Trump&#39;s policy on covid-19
2021-08-12T22:53:43Z,You stand in my way I become a BULLDOZER TO PUSH YOU OUT OF MY WAY. BECAUSE I WILL NOT DIE AND I WILL PROTECT MY CHILDREN. 💀💀
2021-08-12T22:53:21Z,Is this what WINNING looks like?
2021-08-12T22:53:18Z,"Do the people of Florida decide what is good for them, or does de santis&gt;"
2021-08-12T22:53:02Z,Please help us here in Florida. DeSantis is killing us.
2021-08-12T22:52:48Z,90% of the kids going to school didn’t have a mask on. Had to take my kids out of school and go into a private school where masks are mandated. Stupid governor
2021-08-14T11:01:00Z,Keep your family safe that’s the primary concern
2021-08-14T13:47:03Z,Kids don&#39;t get sick!!!!!!???
2021-08-14T14:15:12Z,Christ is King and Lord.
2021-08-14T17:24:27Z,I would have no sympathy It covid took this narcissistic lunatic out. He’s revolting and disgusting. I can’t stand the sight of him or even his voice. He even just looks like such a POS human being on sight.  I have no idea what people saw in this individual when they voted for him.  It’s disturbing.
2021-08-14T17:56:16Z,"Great ,keep them there and STFU"
2021-08-12T22:52:36Z,"If desantis and his followers are against wearing masks, I would like to see them go into a room with a person that has covid without a mask"
2021-08-12T22:52:10Z,Trump supporters deserve this for all that they&#39;ve done to ruin our country.
2021-08-12T22:51:04Z,"Looks like their are 2 STDs on the wang of United States, 1 named Trump and the other named DeSantis."
2021-08-12T22:50:22Z,Politicians like DeSantis need to be arrested for crimes against humanity.
2021-08-12T22:49:37Z,More propaganda.....the hospitals there are not experiencing this fear mongering BS!!!
2021-08-12T22:49:31Z,Trumps little child.

2021-08-14T04:26:27Z,"Ron Death Sentence says hello. The media is wrong, squeaky voice Ron don’t like numbers. The Delta runs Florida, we know it. Wearing a masks saves lives, it’s known. Fauci that stupid Governor, worst Harvard graduate ever."
2021-08-12T22:44:24Z,When DESANTIS faces GOD what will the outcome be good or bad?
2021-08-12T22:43:21Z,With no Accountability the GOP Nazi&#39;s will do every thing and anything they can.
2021-08-12T22:42:59Z,Vaccine passports would be way closer to 1984 than simply not having them. Who believes this guys BS
2021-08-12T22:40:22Z,Good Catholic is disagreeing with the Pope. The Diocese here in FL are stepping up for the most part but are private schools. Like where his children will attend when they&#39;re old enough. Bet that nanny has a mask on tho
2021-08-12T22:40:20Z,It&#39;s getting to the point where we should be afraid of America in the same way we are scared of the Taliban..America has more religious fanatics than any Muslim state.............
2021-08-12T22:40:07Z,"Why not report the truth, like the Joke biden crime ring is sending the illegal aliens from the southwestern border to Florida to make sure the Wu flu is there!"
2021-08-12T22:38:54Z,He should be removed from office ASAP!!! This guy&#39;s killing people for his stupidities.
2021-08-12T22:38:36Z,"The right only care about you whilst you are in the womb. Once you&#39;re out, your nothing but an extorted cash cow and a political pawn. Expendable for any agenda that benifits them."
2021-08-12T22:37:46Z,Fine. Go ahead and let them secede and put the military on their border since they should all be home soon. Don&#39;t let anybody out

2021-08-12T22:36:38Z,"Desantis promote vaccination, STOP assigning BLAMES.  FIX THE PROBLEM, DON&#39;T BE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM."
2021-08-12T22:35:13Z,"For the most part, who are the ones coming down with the virus and the ones that are dying?<br>They are the ones listening to Governor DeSantis.<br>There goes your voting base, Governor . . .<br>How DUMB is that?"
2021-08-12T22:35:10Z,"Dang, so many of these anchors are blind.  Ari, if one day the government wants to inject something in you that you don&#39;t want in you for whatever ever reason you&#39;d just succumb?  Gosh, man I can&#39;t imagine the future you guys are setting a dangerous precedent.  They will inject something in you in the future and you&#39;re not going to want it...too phucking bad.  Just take it!"
2021-08-12T22:35:10Z,These governors are losing credibility.
2021-08-12T22:34:43Z,Texas and Florida voters at fault. Nobody else.
2021-08-12T22:34:16Z,Attacking kids and their education is NEVER a good idea 💡 DeSantis only cares for himself!
2021-08-12T22:34:06Z,Trump&#39;s Mini-Me.
2021-08-12T22:33:58Z,some parents that are f*<b>***</b> stupid like at the one you see in Florida what kind of father you guys are what kind of animals you guys are don&#39;t think about your kids
2021-08-12T22:33:51Z,DeSATIN.
2021-08-12T22:33:21Z,"Two reasons this guy maintains his stance against Covid Guidelines are: 1. He&#39;s a hardcore Republican, Trump loving disciple of the Ultra Right Wing, do exactly the opposite of the Democrats no matter what it is politician and 2. He runs a State that produces Oranges and a &quot;Good Time!&quot; He can still sell Oranges during Covid-19 restrictions, but he can&#39;t sell a Good Time. That is where Florida makes most of its money. It&#39;s a Party State. Just ask Bikers and College Kids! No party? No reason to go to Florida!!!"
2021-08-12T22:33:20Z,sounds like trump
2021-08-12T22:33:13Z,"Let nature sort out the ones so eager to be pathologically suicidal, at this rate."
2021-08-12T22:33:11Z,This guy (and others like him) should be sued by the family members of the Covid dead.
2021-08-12T22:32:05Z,Just report news. Don’t give us your opinion
2021-08-12T22:29:08Z,"I hear the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjXbTRMyOx8&amp;t=3m00s"">3:00</a> minute of this video, almost everywhere I go."
2021-08-12T22:28:16Z,"At this point I think that the insurance companies should just start denying coverage for people that have chosen to not get a vaccine for a non-medical reason. That means if someone has a religious reason, political reason, or they are just afraid of the vaccine, any reason other than medical contraindication they should be denied insurance coverage for their treatment for Covid."
2021-08-13T20:45:46Z,Yes. I&#39;m surprised this hasn&#39;t happened already. People willingly exposing themselves to bodily harm and/or death is not insurable by definition.
2021-08-12T22:28:15Z,"I have checked on the effects of re-breathing CO2, which is what happens when you wear a mask and they scare me! They include; Cardiovascular Problems, Nerve Damage, Asphyxiation, which can lead to permanent damage, or death. Hypoxemia, if this happens and your brain gets depleted of oxygen, you lose consciousness and after 4 minutes, you start to experience brain damage. Check with your health care provider they can confirm these effects. Not to mention our children would be expected to wear these mask 7, plus hours per day."
2021-08-12T22:27:37Z,"Tank Good🙏 i love my land,her vi taken the vaccin, and the kids to,so happy😁🇸🇪"
2021-08-12T22:26:46Z,"Listen to Other news, not just the Democrat owned news media, to get the truth!"
2021-08-12T22:25:26Z,"I thought republicans were pro life, these governors don&#39;t give a dam about these children that are being exposed to covid, Banning mask mandatest = MURDER!!!!!"
2021-08-12T22:22:25Z,Never mistake what Republican Politicians do for caring. They are self serving to the core.
2021-08-12T22:20:48Z,"The GOP is full of ticking time bombs. DeSantis, Green, Paul, Cruz. All misguided idealogs on the Trump hate and ignorance path leading America into the moral abiss."
2021-08-12T22:20:32Z,Arrest him for being a dictator
2021-08-12T22:19:52Z,They don’t care about the American people him an abbot it’s all about the money first
2021-08-12T22:19:33Z,Jezus what an arrogant sob.
2021-08-12T22:18:57Z,So he is stopping parents from keeping their kids safe.
2021-08-12T22:18:40Z,Where do you get the shirts?
2021-08-12T22:18:34Z,He knows that by acting like Trump.. he will get Trump supporters to vote for him in 2024
2021-08-12T22:17:43Z,"Horrible man without a soul. This is what happens when politic ambitions take precedent over the lives of children, State and Democracy. Shut down Disney again and see how long he survives..."
2021-08-12T22:17:21Z,Another  Hitler
2021-08-12T22:16:49Z,"I&#39;m not surprised about Death Santis , I&#39;m amazed at his followers that are just as evil as he is.  Only looking out for themselves as if they live in this world alone"
2021-08-13T14:09:14Z,"Mari Moore, just like Hitler and Charles Manson who had their followers brainwashed into doing or saying what ever they were told. No different."
2021-08-12T22:16:43Z,"Hahahahaaha  you media wished you lived in Florida,  good luck in New York and California, that is the disaster you speak of,  good luck"
2021-08-12T22:15:10Z,Wait. Is he fighting so students have the “right” to not wear masks?? Seriously?????
2021-08-14T02:10:19Z,"Yes, he is that dumb."
2021-08-12T22:13:48Z,Mini-Trump! LOL! Love it!

2021-08-12T22:13:14Z,Desantis just wait until someone you love gets covid and dies…let’s see how it changes you. You are a disgrace!
2021-08-12T22:13:11Z,Gov DeSantis should be impeached. He is setting up Florida Citizens to Danger Their Lives
2021-08-12T22:12:30Z,Anyone who has just a Drop of common sense knows what Desantis is doing is akin to MASS MURDER to deny the people of Florida the right to medicine that can save lives is evil.  Ask this question is it better to have or to have not when it comes to the Covid Vaccine?  PLEASE be truthful in your answer. We can see that Americans are dying more so than in any other STATE when looking at FLORIDA.
2021-08-12T22:11:59Z,I was awaiting the moment when DeSantis would pivot on his COVID stance.  Now I&#39;m having doubts.  I waiver between thinking he WANTS a surge of COVID deaths OR...........???.........
2021-08-13T22:27:52Z,Can&#39;t make a u turn now. That would beg the question of who is responsible for things getting this bad in the first place.
2021-08-12T22:10:55Z,DeSantis should be tried for crimes against humanity!
2021-08-12T22:10:02Z,This governor should be taken out of office he&#39;s a total looser he doesn&#39;t worry about his State he worry&#39;s about himself while people are dieing open your eyes Florida people
2021-08-12T22:08:33Z,"Oh my word, another Trump"

2021-08-12T22:07:25Z,"Good luck ,this guy is a trumpy follow forget the people.I service the rich only and you on your own. Thank you for your vote."
2021-08-12T22:06:54Z,"DeSantis here&#39;s your solution, Florida... Nobody in Nobody out. You guys can live like Manhattan in Escape from New York until you get your crap together"
2021-08-12T22:06:51Z,That clown is getting his own people sick. Lol just like Trump.
2021-08-12T22:06:24Z,"Desantis is right, covid is here, it’s not going away, and we need to learn to live with it. And main stream media needs to stop with the ceaseless conflating and scare mongering"
2021-08-12T22:04:13Z,He just lost the election
2021-08-12T22:04:01Z,He needs to be held accountable this is going on two years now he should know that covert and Delta viruses do killed
2021-08-12T22:03:27Z,"This might sound heartless, but this just means less GOP voters next election.  He&#39; hurting himself politically."
2021-08-12T22:03:20Z,"Most of the people making their comments are forgetting the Constitution, there are a few Governors that follow it, if you loose it you will loose your freedoms and your cushy way of life. We are a Nation of laws based on a God given freedom paid by the sacrifice and blood of many. You ungrateful SOBs!!!"
2021-08-12T22:02:46Z,This is what Republican voters like. They&#39;ve lost their minds.

2021-08-13T12:05:22Z,@@2eroumgme753 That&#39;s not my idea. I do believe I saw those shirts  online somewhere so someone else already makes them I&#39;m sure you could find one with an online search. If I remember correctly the words are inside of an outline of the country. It&#39;s pretty cool I&#39;m going to try to find one myself. Good luck in your search!
2021-08-13T17:02:35Z,"I think Meidas Touch came up with those, there’s probably links on their channel for anyone who wants one"

2021-08-12T21:51:48Z,What A TRUMP DUMMY!!
2021-08-12T21:51:13Z,"Deshameless only cares about his “election bid” for 2024…as with any Trumplican when confronted with the fact they are a failure they love to make it about the border,  blame the media, and blame the Democrats."
2021-08-14T00:09:11Z,"In my past dealings and training I can and have read many a person from liars to those committing crimes due to black mail.

2021-08-14T00:09:57Z,"Unbelievable! Governor, the people need your help!  Do not abandon them! They fear for their health and life."
2021-08-12T21:49:59Z,It should be a felony offense for anybody who isnt a doctor in any position of leadership to make decisions regarding public health! When was the last time your local mayor responded to a dangerous and threatening situation to administer critical care and expertise?
2021-08-12T21:49:50Z,What does it take to replace stupid by criminal ?
2021-08-12T21:49:38Z,One way to look at this is that mostly Trump supporters will die of covid. Weird that the GOP is okay with that.
2021-08-12T21:49:33Z,3  key ingredients to be a  repugnican: 1. Deflect   2. Deflect again. 3. If that doesn&#39;t work deflect more

2021-08-12T21:48:24Z,Maybe DeSantis doing all these things that he doesn&#39;t careless of the citizens in Florida for Politics apportioned therefore next Election will not have a lot of potential to Votes so he will win again or he can cheated 😉🤷🤔🙄😜 😉 ..
2021-08-12T21:47:22Z,Sounds like you guys want Nazi control State and in America. Where can I get one of those sweet shirts
2021-08-12T21:46:57Z,"This is the type of governor every state needs, the lying media never tells the truth. I had the virus a diabetic and did the right natural remedies and killed the virus. Garlic, Lemon, honey vitamins D3, C, zinc green tea. Strengthen  your immune system.  Don&#39;t believe the media, you will be put in harm&#39;s way. If you get this virus attack it right away."

2021-08-12T21:45:34Z,"Freedom state? There is no freedom in a coffin, you can&#39;t get up and walk around in a coffin. Freedom and rights? You have no gun rights to bear arms when on a ventilator. Freedom to control what happens to your body? Sorry you have no choice when the nurse come to put the catheter in... What i want to know is how can the Republican party allow all these UN-vaccinated people and anti mask, anti vax politicians to ROB PEOPLE OF THEIR FREEDOM?  DeSantis is actually taking away the rights and freedom of tens of thousands of people daily in the state of Florida.<br>I prefer to live in a state free of CoVID not on fire with COVID."

2021-08-12T21:43:55Z,Yes masking children is the worst thing you can do to a child. Your muting that child and damaging that child. Research masks during the Spanish flu. It made kids sicker.
2021-08-12T21:42:54Z,"This guy has found like Trump has, they can say anything they want to as truth and the cult will believe every word that blows out of their <br>a!s…"

2021-08-12T21:37:25Z,"DeSantis&#39;s way of coping with COVID-19 is to let the people in his state die!  There will no lock down, no mask, and no vaccine.  Is this how he plans to defeat the virus and make America great again!"
2021-08-12T21:35:58Z,Thats the point. A mini ME destroying the lives of others. Loyal to stupid till the end.

2021-08-12T21:31:50Z,Trump is his good friend. Dump &amp; dumper
2021-08-12T21:31:31Z,This is what happens when you elect a sociopathic political leader who puts their political aspirations ahead of citizen&#39;s lives. It&#39;s a disaster in the making.
2021-08-12T21:31:04Z,Desantis San not become a leaders USA because he is a follower who follows stupid Trump.
2021-08-12T21:29:52Z,Killing off his base while taking million$ of dollar$ from them.  Just proves that America is NOT a country - it&#39;s a BUSINESS.  Atta-boy Ronnie you&#39;re a true Republican.
2021-08-12T21:29:48Z,The governor  suffers from diarrhea of the brain. Dis santiritis presents a clear and present danger to the health of Floridans.
2021-08-12T21:29:36Z,Will DeSantis take full responsibility for anyone in Florida who dies or who is left very ill because of covid with  his rules. It&#39;s one thing to say something but its another thing to do something about it. Actions speak louder than words.  Stand by what your saying prove your words.
2021-08-12T21:29:14Z,If one want to become the USA President. One has to be honest as Abraham Lincoln. Desantis  is a laughing stock.
2021-08-12T21:29:01Z,Hey Ronnie we want Charlie Crist  in your job . He is a human  being and not a self centered psychopathic thing.
2021-08-12T21:28:36Z,"Desantis voters don&#39;t care if their school age kids or elderly relatives get covid or die, as long he validates their grivances, bigotry and vilness, they crave politicians like him"
2021-08-12T21:26:57Z,"Why aren’t politicians that are doing this being charge with criminal negligence? If they are purposely trying to aid the spread of a deadly virus and coursing thousands to die, they should be brought up on charges"
2021-08-12T21:25:46Z,Guido needs to be recalled.
2021-08-12T21:24:08Z,"DeSantis your the problem to your state. You have been bitten by the trumper snake. Ron Dr Santos you are full of position. The way you are going, you will not be the governor of Florida next term. Your on your way to killing a lot of good people. I will not vote for you st all, your a killer."

2021-08-12T21:22:35Z,His name is Deathsantis. Let&#39;s make it stick like &quot;Lyin Ted&quot; or &quot;Crooked Hillary&quot;. Fight like they do or lose everything.
2021-08-12T21:22:14Z,People voted for him. That&#39;s the sad part
2021-08-12T21:21:29Z,What a stupid governor in Florida!
2021-08-12T21:20:47Z,"I had a situation at work of our employees working with sand.  OSHA came in for inspection and suggested we recommend the employees wear mask.   But they told me I could not mandate it to the employees.  I asked why?  They informed me that there are particles that come off masks and end up in peoples lungs.  That in turn can lead to allergic asphaltic shock, sometimes death.  There are also lawsuit cases on this, as well as mask particles leading to cancer in the lungs.  Years ago, I remember some medical research where the researchers were amazed how little a particle needed to be to cause tumors, or lung infections.  We are asking people to wear masks all day in school or the office.  Many people also reuse mask as they create they create more particles from more wear."
2021-08-12T21:20:22Z,Desantis is a stupid liar.
2021-08-12T21:20:21Z,Much worst than the Cuomo scandal! Why cant we get him out of office ?
2021-08-12T21:20:07Z,"He moves his hands as Trump!!! He&#39;s a mini Trump!!! But he&#39;s not going to win, because he&#39;s killing all the Republicans!"
2021-08-12T21:18:21Z,"Interesting choice of words … dead wrong …. If the shoe fits DeSantis, wear it. You are guilty of crimes against humanity and manslaughter"
2021-08-12T21:17:55Z,“a mess of his making” 🙌🏽
2021-08-12T21:17:41Z,Any bets that DeSantis is fully vaccinated?
2021-08-12T21:17:14Z,"Its insane, trump first,now another monster version of  the older traitor monster..."
2021-08-12T21:17:09Z,Let them die until the people turn around! And start complaining at him! With his political lies he and his followers deserve what ever is coming to them.
2021-08-12T21:16:31Z,"That&#39;s right Deathsantis blame everyone else don&#39;t take responsibility for killing your people. Shame on you!! ...and you like this Guy, Florida? This is your Leader? Wow!! He doesn&#39;t care about you! The law suits should start rolling in."
2021-08-12T21:15:35Z,His hands gestures is basically Donald trump
2021-08-12T21:15:02Z,The fact that desantis can fundraise says a lot about the GOP in Florida.
2021-08-12T21:13:55Z,"Good job, Ari"
2021-08-12T21:13:50Z,DeSantis is an self serving demigod or so he thinks and maga will sink him.

2021-08-12T21:11:26Z,DeSantis complains about &quot;wide open southern borders&quot;. This is a flagrant lie!<br>The southrrn borders are not wide open and he knows it. This man is reckless and irresponsible.
2021-08-12T21:40:33Z,Clearly trump sent his &quot;build the wall&quot; lackeys to talk to desantis. Just sounds like an echo of trumps campaign.
2021-08-12T21:09:54Z,"DeSantis is counting on replacing those lost dead workers with employees of corporations he&#39;s lured to Florida with visions of higher profits than the states they move from. It&#39;s intentional. There is a method behind his cruelty, just like Trump.<br><br>DeSantis is decreasing the renter and homeowner numbers intentionally. He doesn&#39;t care about individuals in his state: he only cares about corporations. He&#39;s made Florida &quot;more attractive&quot; to corporations to make higher profits, and those corporations that move there are going to need places for their employees to live. DeSantis&#39; solution: let covid get rid of the elderly and lower income homeowners. He&#39;s just hoping no one will notice.<br><br>DeSantis is counting on the pandemic timeline and thinks that by the time elections come around covid will be gone and he&#39;ll easily win either re-election or become the republican presidential candidate."
2021-08-13T17:42:16Z,Not bad... hadnt thought of it from that perspective...
2021-08-12T21:07:30Z,Too many paid people to recommend ⚠️ poison ☠️ vaccines No approved yet
2021-08-12T21:06:48Z,I can&#39;t help but remember the major in Jaws who didn&#39;t want to close the beaches because they would lose revenue/economy. DeSantis is doing the same thing with a pandemic virus.
2021-08-12T21:11:07Z,Only it&#39;s backfiring because Fla.&#39;s economy is dying because of his lack of leadership.
2021-08-12T21:32:21Z,Republicans against abortion now against mask/vaccines. If you republicans are only using their arguments as a ploy and using the unborn and the born as pawns in their BS political arguments.
2021-08-12T21:06:10Z,"Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is not.... liberty, death and the pursuit of misery. These people can not grasp that."

2021-08-12T21:04:12Z,Stop been political be honest journalist please
2021-08-12T21:03:49Z,"We have the same problem here in S Carolina! Governor McMaster and the legislature passed a law last week that forbids the schools from having staff and children to wear masks. He&#39;s doing the same thing as Abbot and Desantis, threatening to pull the schools funding if they mandate children and staff wear masks. That also goes for public buildings and businesses! These governors(also in Missouri, Arkansas etc.) are going to end up killing a couple hundred thousand of our citizens just like Trump!"
2021-08-12T21:01:55Z,"It&#39;s time we clean our states of these dangerous morons like DeSantis.  We need to start standing up not with violence but with Civil Disobedience as Dr. King and Gandhi did.  The sane individuals need to take this country back.  Politicians work for us, not for themselves.  GOP members have sold their souls to Trump.  Do we want men  like <br>Trump and DeSantis to take us down.  Fight back; wear masks get vaccinated and listen to Dr. Fauci."
2021-08-12T21:01:08Z,We have to start giving mentality and sanity tests to politicians before taking ANY political position period.
2021-08-12T21:01:00Z,"what is wrong with DeSantis&#39;s followers?  DeSantis and Abbott are embracing Dr Death policies.  So many people are suffering from Covid, including children.  Who&#39;s paying for the hospital costs for the short range as well as the long range effects?  Send your bills to the Governors who encourage the spread by mandating stupid Covid policies."
2021-08-12T20:59:42Z,"Ari, this aligns with the conspiracy theories out there.  They all sing the same song."
2021-08-12T20:58:45Z,I hope Floridians are not stupid. It seems like the governor is trying to wait out the whole surge in Florida so he can talk about something else during the election. I hope this governor gets voted out of office by the people whom he left behind. I hope the Floridian people remember this Covid situation and how he miss handled it
2021-08-12T20:58:38Z,Ignorant and incompetent like his orange master.
2021-08-12T20:58:26Z,How many parents in Florida do not want masks?
2021-08-12T20:57:45Z,As I meant to say Ron DeSantis is another Republican sadist who only care about his political career power and his pocket he cares nothing about how many people die how many people will die in the future how many kids die all he cares about is money and power and himself I will never deal with a Florida company unless they get rid of the sentence same thing in Texas I will not deal with any Texas company unless they get rid of their governor if anything with North Carolina South Carolina and so forth Georgia I live in I have to buy some goods here but I will buy nothing major from Georgia company that care about voting rights care about the people care about if they live or die they&#39;re the ones pushing for stimulus and everything not the Republicans they want to take everything away from you and the Democrats are the only ones giving you anything or doing anything for you so remember that Republicans when it comes time to vote get rid of these Republican governors once and for all because the Democrats are the only one doing anything for anybody all the Republicans do is obstruct and Trump is being proven to be a major liar thief and everything and you&#39;re just starting to realize it now it took you four years or so but your least you&#39;re getting the point now
2021-08-12T20:56:56Z,Where is the DOJ IN ALL OF THIS ?
2021-08-12T20:56:49Z,Here is how he could get out of this with some respect. Admit he was wrong and say he is sorry and move on.. But nooooo. He likes to be in the news.
2021-08-12T20:56:35Z,Demonsanti LITERALLY does not care about people dying at all. They are the last thing on his mind. He only has trump n being in the White House as the next President only.
2021-08-12T20:56:24Z,Give me freedom or give me death! I think this one you can have it both ways if you listen to Deathsantis

2021-08-12T20:54:03Z,Shame on him...and the cruel part of his stupidity is that we..the citizens have to swallow all his nonsense. Unless we do something about it. Believe me not everybody is so stupid as he is.
2021-08-12T20:54:03Z,There’s no talks of personal freedom when you are in a pandemic the first amendment cannot even help you with this. You do not have the freedom to make someone else for ill or sick or even something else.
2021-08-12T20:53:54Z,Thanks to these monsters we now have children on ventilators fighting for their lives
2021-08-12T20:53:53Z,mini-trump is putting lives in danger. He does not care about the children in the ICU units.
2021-08-12T20:53:01Z,It&#39;s really sad how they&#39;re allowing him to do all what he&#39;s done and what he&#39;s doing wow

2021-08-12T20:50:08Z,He is so pitiful so terrible
2021-08-12T20:50:03Z,"Mini-trump wants to get 600k(+) kills under his belt so he can be just like daddy!  When an average Jane/Joe kills people he/she is hunted down put in prison or put to death.

2021-08-12T20:20:26Z,"The thing that gets me is he supposedly cares about the parents choice, yet he doesn&#39;t give a damned about the parents who would choose differently than himself.  The parents who want mask mandates to keep their children safe.  Ahh, screw them I guess."
2021-08-13T09:48:36Z,You cant care about choice and mandates. Either Americans have the freedom to choose or they dont . How could someone want the choice to not have a choice?
2021-08-13T18:47:36Z,@@jonokarski6202 Exactly. No one is saying students CAN NOT wear masks. DeSantis is only saying it is up to the parents if their child whom they love and protect should wear a mask or not. It&#39;s not up to some school board who only see your precious child as a number for federal and local funds. We all should have the freedom to choose! That is what this is about. This is the line drawn to protect more freedoms down the road.Thank God for this man standing up for our freedoms!

Not because you are just plain wrong, but because you don&#39;t even see why. YOUR selfish interpretation of personal &quot;freedom&quot; does not trump MY right to life guaranteed by the constitution. I am one of those people that will die if I get this virus. Why am I and those like me in that over 600 thousand expendable? Why do we have no value as human beings to you? Where is the &quot;sanctity&quot; of human life?

2021-08-12T18:56:15Z,"Yeah this is a complete lie. My parents are down in Florida and they are telling me of how great life is down there. Low unemployment rate, no mask mandates, hospitals have volume but not anywhere near capacity. Swarms of development and people moving to the state with no income taxes. People are respectful to each other and live life like normal. Mom just had a surgery and she was in and out in a few hours with little to no stress. MSM wants you to keep living in fear and goes after states that are actually trying to get life back to normal, by pulling some data and trying to paint a horrible picture. This country needs more governors like DeSantis, and I would move to Florida in a heartbeat if not for the heat."

My very good friend&#39;s 2 -17 year of age children, with their father, who had the Covid shots back in April, now have the Covid-Delta variant symptoms, and yesterday waited 4 hours in the Florida heat, feeling very ill and had to sit in a car for 4 hours! <br><br>These teens are honor students and very active in sports, and have worn masks, safe-distanced, and yet they and all of the others, in the state of Florida, who have had the shots, have no way of protecting themselves from the arrogance, ignorance from those who refuse to do so!<br><br>It is also apparent, that going to and receiving college degrees from expensive prestigious colleges like Harvard Law School and Yale University, as you have, does NOT make you an authority on all subjects, especially when one greatly lacks common sense-a heart! <br><br>Further, it also does NOT take a person with a college degree to realize their limitations, or when their knowledge is lacking in certain areas such as science/medicine, it takes the ability of logical thinking, acknowledging the facts/data.<br><br> Florida has been in the top 5 states for infected cases and deaths, a majority of the time since Covid-19 started, and NOW- NUMBER 1-with the Delta Variant with infected cases and deaths.<br><br>Desantis, you have had the opportunity, and all the tools necessary at your disposal to implement all of the necessary changes from the start of this Covid-19 crisis, in order to protect ALL the people of your state-Florida, and yet you have rejected common sense, medical/scientific experts, and the educators in your state&#39;s advice, and all for your own political aspirations-over reality!<br><br>I believe you should step down immediately, in order for a person who has the necessary knowledge, experience, common sense, heart, and has ALL the Floridians best interest at heart, to take charge- one who WILL take the long overdue actions necessary to fight the Covid-19 crisis in Florida!<br>(and another friend after I wrote the above called, who lives in South Fl, Miami area said her children waited 7 hours to get tested!)."

2021-08-12T18:40:38Z,"DeSantis is pro-vaccine and choice. He is against mandates. Please, as one additional means of fighting this virus, maybe someone should stop the 200,000 not vaccinated, not tested people per month from crossing the southern border and being shipped into southern states. Everyone needs to be vaccinated for the greater good - unless your doctor advises otherwise. Also, educate the people on the only somewhat effective mask: the N95 mask."

However, what he shouldn&#39;t do is threaten people&#39;s livelihood that choose to follow the science, wear masks and vaccinate. The Governor of Florida is a loathsome &amp; demonic creature! Attacking Fauci is so juvenile!! Republicans are nothing more than a QaNon psychotic demonic juvenile acting cult!"
2021-08-12T17:53:16Z,He does not care about the kids because they can not vote so they are expendable. As are the elderly and the sick. His ego knows no bounds.

2021-08-12T19:40:31Z,He&#39;s so anti government that he (the government) is telling schools and businesses what to do. He&#39;s a hypocrite and a trump wannabe.
2021-08-12T23:21:22Z,It&#39;s almost as if we&#39;re back at square one with the rona here in Florida and it just doesn&#39;t make sense.  This was mostly preventable.  I can&#39;t stand our governor!
2021-08-13T00:14:20Z,DeSantis is a child killer in my opinion! He is not right in his head! F U creep

SMH….I don’t disagree with everything the right thinks but I would never vote for someone like DeSantis, Trump, Graham, McConnell, Hawley or any of these other fascists."
2021-08-12T17:01:49Z,Maybe DeSantis thinks that dead people vote in the election so he securing their vote by killing them. 🤣🤣

2021-08-12T16:56:37Z,DeSantis will urge Covid precautions as soon as he can figure out how to convincingly blame it on a Democrat.
2021-08-13T00:30:38Z,he already has
2021-08-13T03:37:38Z,"Isn&#39;t he actually putting the  blame  on the Latinos of  Florida, the outsiders?"
2021-08-13T17:35:39Z,They are blaming vaccine hesitancy on Biden for saying once that he doesn&#39;t trust Trump who incorrectly stated a vaccine was weeks away.  He said he would trust the medical professionals (but they don&#39;t mention that).
2021-08-14T23:10:48Z,He blamed china now its the southern border and immigrants and he&#39;s working on blaming someone else for his mishandling of this virus his state is open borders for the virus its bad now give it to the end of next week He will be dodging the reporters
2021-08-12T16:54:47Z,What about DeSantis blocking information from the public access of how many were infected with COVID last year?  Sheriff&#39;s have access to that information in the capacity of their work with the public and at least one sheriff would then publish it in the newspaper so people would know if it was rampant in their community.

2021-08-12T16:52:05Z,"Curious.  Is ANYONE informing DeSantis his base is NOT vaccinating and his base is DYING from this Delta variant?  &quot;Uh!  Governer?  Your supporting voter base dropped by 15%, last week.  Meanwhile, the number of citizens voting against you is unchanged and still HIGHER than your best, base assessment.  By the way, I&#39;m resigning and taking a position with The Florida Democratic Committee.  Adios, loser.&quot;"
2021-08-12T16:51:58Z,"He can play with lives, because he’s vaccinated!"

2021-08-13T15:25:47Z,"@@theogstasimay Absolutely darlin&#39;.  You are so right. It stuns me to see so many people listening to DeSantis.  I live in Newfoundland, Canada.  We have zero cases of Covid at the moment. We no longer have to wear masks since Tuesday but most of us are still wearing them just to be on the safe side because it is tourist season and don&#39;t think it is  a good time to drop the mask mandate. I am sure at some point we will be hit with Delta so therefore our children are in danger.  The adults have to take responsibility for them and that is exactly what we are doing.  I am very happy with the way our federal and provincial governments have handled the pandemic so far.  I have not heard ANY of our leaders have breathed a word of the opposite of what our health authorities have warned us about.  My heart breaks for the innocent adults and children who have been hit with this tragedy and who have followed all the guidelines but because of the disregard for human life of the antivaxxers and anti maskers they are no longer with us.  So sorry for what you guys are going through,  Protect yourself and ignore the Governor."
2021-08-13T19:13:46Z,"He can still get it, vaccinated or not. Lindsey Graham is just one example"
2021-08-12T16:51:49Z,"Ask yourself this would Jesus have taken the vax? Would he fear and tremble because of a virus with a 98.5% survival rate? I think not!! Actually his response would be to repent. Repent from our sins not take a vax to save your job( God will provide you another one) or because you smoke cigarettes or are overweight. Why? Because He loves us and it is sin that causes death. Sin is the enemies tool to cause harm in our lives. To cause sickness, pain, and suffering. There isnt a vax that man can make that can save you from sin or its consequences. Only Jesus can truly save and truly heal. Walk in love my friends."
2021-08-12T16:48:15Z,"The virus is twice as contagious but spreading five times as fast because no one is doing anything to mitigate the spread. Vaccinated and  Unvaccinated are walking around like Typhoid Mary. Wearing a mask doesn&#39;t protect you, it stops you from breathing on other people and making them sick and then going home and making others sick."
2021-08-12T16:47:41Z,Takes a special kind of evil to look for political gain at the expense of your own constituents. Wake up Floridians. You deserve better than that.

2021-08-12T16:45:56Z,DeSantis is a murderer and he knows it. And the people he&#39;s killing love him for it. Idiocy and greed will be the death of us.
2021-08-12T16:45:52Z,"How is the Governor of CA staring at a recall election, brought to you by partisan Republicans, for keeping his people safe and these two cavernous-jack-holes in TX and FL are literally killing people because of their policies and they can run again and sadly might win?

Looks like he swallowed a pyhton or an alligator. You don&#39;t see these people in any country. Only in the good old USA! Folks who are against basic science. Does he use soap? No need! The difference between our country and the rest of the world is that we tolerate these men who are essentially ignorant criminals.

2021-08-12T16:19:44Z,"The media praised Cuomo despite his policies that put Covid patients in NURSING HOMES, the only reason that the media is attacking Desantis is because he won’t cave to the Covid Cult. Authoritarianism is not the answer."
2021-08-12T16:19:19Z,"The state that is 3rd in order of population surprises people that it leads in cases? Who should lead ? Delaware? Maryland? Rhode Island? People choosing to get vaccinated or not is not the governments choice. Saying the governor is to blame is typical of the warped views of the left. Biden calling American citizens &quot; stupid &quot; for not getting a shot. This dude Ari now calling DeSantis stupid and claiming DeSantis reads and writes at a second grade level is also typical of the left. Believing the government should be involved in personal medical decisions is ridiculous. Not reporting on all the facts is not reporting the news. The CDC has admitted it reported wrong numbers concerning Florida and it&#39;s daily covid cases. The CDC released a three day total as a one day new case count. The CDC does not release information over the weekend. Instead, on Tuesday it would release Saturday, Sunday and Mondays individual numbers for each day. It reported those three days as only one day giving Saturday and Sunday numbers credit to Monday. Monday had so high a number that it broke many records but when the discrepancy was reported the media didn&#39;t bother to explain any of this , the media chose to continue to bash Florida for letting people continue to choose if they wanted to  get an experimental medication shot. Continuing to let people choose if they want a shot is somehow wrong now? Getting a shot guarantees you nothing. It may help you not get as sick but it doesn&#39;t guarantee you that you won&#39;t get sick. You may not die but people have died after getting a shot and being infected with covid. Covid isn&#39;t going away. It will have surges by region and helping alleviate the symptoms should the goal  instead of putting fear in people that those not getting a shot are the reason covid is on the rise. People who are &quot; vaccinated &quot; can get covid and spread covid just like an &quot; unvaccinated &quot; person can. All the &quot; data &quot; the media says it uses has no legitimacy when it&#39;s data is collected over weeks or maybe some months instead of the years that are required to ensure complete understanding is accomplished regarding safety and effectiveness of the medication. FDA website states 10-12 years is the &quot; average &quot; time for a &quot;vaccine &quot; to be submitted and approved if its approved at all. It also states that of 100 medications submitted, maybe 1 will actually be approved. Now 3 separate companies submitted &quot; vaccines &quot; for approval and all 3 for emergency use approval. So why would anyone want to mass produce and attempt to get the entire world inoculated with an emergency use experimental medication? The government attempts at getting people to get a shot has gone way overboard. Offering cash incentives for a medication that Biden and Harris refused to take last year is now ok?? Even if the FDA approves it soon that will only show that political pressure has no business in medical research. Not enough time has passed to know all that needs to be known about covid. No trials that the FDA requires have been completed. These medications may help the short term effects but any long term knowledge of there effectiveness is unknown. The long term effects on people&#39;s lungs from wearing masks all day and rebreathing gases already exhaled is unknown. The long term after effects of covid in people who were infected. But let&#39;s keep reporting on trying to blame someone else for the choices people make. That really helps."

Let that sink in. Look at India’s recent outbreak. They’ll be another in India because India doesn’t have the resources to vaccinate enough people fast enough.

I encounter dead people being put into morgue trucks twice while going to the grocery store.<br><br>New Yorkers were not whining...We didn&#39;t want the rest of the country to go through what we went through...It&#39;s sad the number of other States that didn&#39;t listen...Now the children are being effected.

We are all part of the Human Race. God help the Floridians and Bless the United States of America. From your Neighbour. Wayne M. 🇨🇦
2021-08-12T14:18:40Z,Time to wall off Florida lol
2021-08-12T14:18:31Z,He&#39;s keeping Florida sick and dying.
2021-08-12T14:18:24Z,"Most of my &quot;Pfizer Vaccinated&quot; family and close friends got infected with covid 19 (no one was hospitalised).  Tell the truth, politician Fauci!🙄 Did you lift the mask requirement too early OR did you lie about vaccine&#39;s effectiveness?🤐🤐🤐🤐"
2021-08-12T16:27:55Z,“No one was hospitalized” is the key statement here. How can you not see that as a good thing from the vaccine?
2021-08-12T14:17:07Z,How is DeSantis 42 years old?  He looks 50.
2021-08-12T14:17:06Z,"Live by the sword, die by the sword."
2021-08-12T14:16:02Z,He&#39;s blackmailing schools. How is that legal?
2021-08-12T14:15:45Z,Where is your mask? What about Obama&#39;s  super spreader?
2021-08-12T14:14:36Z,DeSantis can&#39;t run his state so what makes him think he can run the country? He could care less about the lives of his constituents and their children. Sounds just like 2016 to 2020 all over again. After bashing the Government now he turns around and begs them for ventilators. Sit back and think about this all you Renegade Republican and ReTrumplican voters in Florida that support this &quot;Moron&quot;. He is killing the citizens and their kids by playing politics instead of doing something to save lives. He is a &quot;Mini-Me&quot; of Donald Trump and is just as worthless!!!!!!
2021-08-12T14:13:55Z,Not stupid. Disgusting.
2021-08-12T14:13:27Z,"The worse America gets, the more the authoritarians take hold. It&#39;s a strategy."
2021-08-12T14:11:39Z,DESANTIS is the equivalent of colostomy bag with holes in it.
2021-08-12T22:05:59Z,Eww.

2021-08-13T04:16:00Z,You still have a right of free speech.    Best watch whom you support if you wish to keep that right in these days of abundant censorship.    A bit more kindness and decorum might serve you well as far as the row dinners that may well come your way.    Said from solid grounding in gratitude and love for humankind.
2021-08-13T09:27:51Z,@@jerrybaker5347 the convo isn&#39;t about censorship its about a ret@rded governor
2021-08-13T12:56:42Z,😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
2021-08-12T14:11:32Z,He should be required to spend time in the hospitals without a mask facing those parents and families of the sick.
2021-08-12T14:11:06Z,going to the best schools and getting good grades doesn&#39;t guarantee  common sense
2021-08-12T14:07:08Z,Florida has been a joke to the rest of the USA for decades over their backward mentality but this new low for Florida just confirms the idiocy of the residents.  Suits me that the two most obnoxious states are killing off their residents with all their anti vaxx nonsense.  Florida and Texas are getting what they deserve
2021-08-12T14:07:05Z,It is time for government to step in I mean my president Biden
2021-08-12T14:06:48Z,Desantis stands up against this blatant covid propaganda.  Thank you Mr Desantis.  Screw these frauds.
2021-08-12T14:06:21Z,The Delta Variant should be renamed the DeSantis Variant
2021-08-12T14:06:14Z,The US is trailing all other G7 nations in all aspects of quality of life.  A major reason is the poor leadership in key States such as Texas and Florida.
2021-08-12T16:41:58Z,"Sure the poor are dying and suffering, think of all the billionaires being made in America."
2021-08-12T14:05:42Z,Governor of death 💀
2021-08-12T14:02:51Z,"His job is to do what is best for Florida but he chooses to do what is best for his party, his desire to hold on to power means his people have to get sick... when you lose the ability to breath, party affiliation seems like the last thing that is important."
2021-08-12T14:01:25Z,"Disgraceful ,disingenuous &amp; selfish!!!"
2021-08-12T14:01:25Z,It&#39;s probably not smart in the long term to encourage your main base to risk their lives on a daily basis.
2021-08-12T13:58:51Z,Oh my God just put on a f@!%ing mask bro!!! 😷
2021-08-12T13:57:55Z,The different debate/ press conference styles could be demonstrated by DeSantis’ press conference early July 2020 vs. now. Side by side.
2021-08-12T13:56:51Z,"The huge spike in Florida&#39;s Covid cases is due to the massive influx of infected people coming across the US/Mexican border into Florida.  Oh, Wait!....     What a clown!"
2021-08-12T13:56:47Z,"DeSantis proves again that he’s nothing but a political hack, playing to the lowest common denominator of his party.<br><br>He’s no leader and he’s incapable of making hard necessary decisions."
2021-08-12T13:55:15Z,I’m calling out Dr. Death 💀 His whole Family has been Vaccinated I haven’t said this in a lot of years” Show me COVID-19 Vaccine 💉 Card I’ll show you mine!” Yeah ya suppose to be”Tough”
2021-08-12T13:54:22Z,Good job De Santis killing all your supporters! You are the problem!!!!
2021-08-12T13:54:14Z,"The minute Desantis started selling shirts and coozies politicizing a worldwide pandemic, he made his motivations very clear."
2021-08-12T16:27:29Z,Politicians are always political.
2021-08-12T17:00:43Z,Ttump&#39;s word (I&#39;d like too punch him)
2021-08-13T10:15:56Z,He is a disgusting vile person.
2021-08-13T13:48:11Z,"Hokie D, and that motivation was: &quot;F*** you, you&#39;re on your own&quot;"
2021-08-16T16:23:49Z,Yes  It&#39;s probably better just to get direct payments from other countries for setting national policy like biden does. Selling things in the free market is a lot less it&#39;s a lot less effective than just having Putin pay you directly. Joe Biden knows how to make money from China.
2021-08-12T13:54:06Z,"DeSantis seems happy to let the citizens in his state get sick, be hospitalised and perhaps die. Stupid doesn&#39;t begin to describe deSantis."
2021-08-12T13:53:28Z,"Vaccines can be mandatory <br>Jacobson v. Mass, 197 U.S. 11 (1905),was a US Sup Ct case in which the Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws.The Court&#39;s ruled that individual liberty is not absolute and is subject to the police power of the state."
2021-08-12T13:53:23Z,America is slowly moving towards a pandemic among unvaccinated Trump supporters. Darwinism at its finest.
2021-08-12T13:52:57Z,Maybe DeSantis should take his beer coozies to a Florida ICU ward and see if he can hawk them there. He proves every day Florida is hands down the dumbest state in America.
2021-08-12T13:51:49Z,We need to stop being selfish and do what’s for the greater good of society
2021-08-12T13:51:38Z,That&#39;s all they do they think about they self and making money raising money that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about the benjamins you don&#39;t care about nothing but raising money that&#39;s all they care about they don&#39;t care about Americans and he&#39;s a disgrace to American people and to the American world that&#39;s my opinion
2021-08-12T13:51:30Z,Great Tittle: he&#39;s nothing more than a mini little tiny creepy Trump!!

2021-08-12T13:51:29Z,The DeSantis clown show may get a rebuff from the constituents when they see their pocketbooks taking a hit.  Florida is completely off my map when it comes to vacation time.  What rational person would drag the family to vacation in the Florida COVID swamp?  That giant sucking sound is the sound of the tourism dollars disappearing.
2021-08-12T23:34:18Z,We&#39;re not making much of a reasonable case for people to come here at the moment.  We&#39;re worse off than Brazil and India.  You have to be really screwed up with the rona as a state to be worse off than those two particular nations.
2021-08-13T00:27:20Z,"Yes, we do. 😪"
2021-08-12T13:51:25Z,Can we be sure that folks visiting Florida are not the ones bringing in the virus?

2021-08-12T13:48:32Z,Sanchez you need to protect the people in Florida and kids that&#39;s y&#39;all duty to do so and that&#39;s my opinion
2021-08-12T13:48:27Z,"How about leaving people alone? If you want to wear a mask, you can. If you don’t want to, you shouldn’t have to."
2021-08-12T13:48:18Z,I am so happy!! Covid hospitalization in Florida is rising....Hail !! De Santis !!
2021-08-12T13:48:00Z,Ron &quot;Delta&#39;Santis&quot; should be impeached and charge with the unnecessary harm done to the people of Florida.
2021-08-12T13:50:20Z,His derilection of his duties as governor have put Florida in harm&#39;s way deliberately.
2021-08-12T13:47:23Z,That governor is evil and sick
2021-08-12T13:47:15Z,The virus is doing what Nature intends it to do.  It&#39;s thinning the herd of mankind.  You have to admit the planet is overpopulated. Every person in the world will encounter COVID at some point.  Some will live and many will die.  That&#39;s the way Nature works.  Mankind can do little to change the course of Nature. Enjoy life while you can you may be next up on Nature&#39;s COVID list.
2021-08-12T13:46:58Z,Is Sanchez he needs to protect the people in Florida he&#39;s the government Joe Biden is just trying to help that&#39;s my opinion
2021-08-12T13:45:41Z,Ok what is Federal Government going to do about him. Intentions are not for saving lives with this man.
2021-08-13T14:44:26Z,Its not the federal governments job to &quot;save your life&quot; lol you should be hedging your own risk accordingly not looking to the government which has historically created more problems than it has solved but now everyone thinks its gonna work? lol grow up.
2021-08-13T14:49:43Z,That’s what I’d like to know as well.  <br><br>I think the Biden admin is asking the DOJ if there’s anything the federal level can legally do to mandate the states with exploding covid cases.  It’s a waiting game...
2021-08-13T15:00:45Z,"@@dutchmaster5637  yes govt cannot save our lives ...we have to do it ourselves.  Problem is while the sensible ones are trying to protect our families , we have to come into public contact with others daily , who for whatever reason, can’t take the necessary precautions to try &amp; protect the general public .  <br>It’s sad, we have become a “every man (and woman) for him/herself  “ society....for the most part."
2021-08-12T13:45:09Z,"DeSantis is yet another example of the poison that arrived with #45.  This poison lingers like the nuclear waste from Chernobyl. Until some real citizens wax a few of these fools in FL/TX, well; this self-destructive behavior will continue unabated.  I cannot stand ignorance of any kind, as it isn&#39;t a valid excuse to harm my fellow citizens and/or my family."
2021-08-12T13:44:59Z,American Politics.  Another sign that the &quot;American Democracy Experiment&quot; is failing.  I am glad I live in the next country and can watch from across the St. Lawrence River.
2021-08-12T13:44:18Z,Doesn’t the governor have a highly trained staff that can prove or disprove the stats on Florida?? So Let’s hear their conclusions. He won’t do that cuz they’ll have to either have to lie for him or confirm the government stats. Either way it’ll end their careers.
2021-08-12T13:44:17Z,the people of florida need to hold the governor accountable and vote him out
2021-08-12T21:08:08Z,DeSantis the new current front runner of the Trump party
2021-08-12T22:10:52Z,"I am outraged at the Florida Governor. The people are not demanding this man step down. Their children have  Covid, yet they they DO NOTHING TO STOP THIS MADNESS. I live in Massachusetts, thank God. People here would get DeSantis out . He makes me sick."

Parents will protect Thier children if Thiers anyway they can quit Thier jobs they will.

2021-08-12T13:37:51Z,DeSantis is probably giving free tickets to Disneyland.
2021-08-12T13:36:38Z,Desantis cares nothing for the people of Florida. He has proven to be incompetent and a repulsive human being 😒🤬
2021-08-12T13:36:38Z,So DeSantis is a Doctor a scientist an expert a Border patrol expert CEO of the health Departments he&#39;s so talented but he takes no responsibility for his people no leadership skills. DeSantis chose his path he&#39;s a Nazi following Hitler.

2021-08-12T13:34:34Z,Seems people that deny and lie abut Mask wearing. Are now asking for ventilators. The culling has began. I work in the medical field.

2021-08-13T13:22:06Z,"I think it&#39;s an overabundance of sources - they don&#39;t like the sound of one, they&#39;ll find another one that they agree with, and follow that. There&#39;s a crowded ecosystem of journalism and news thanks to our immediate virtual connection, and this desire to report first. People can mistake editorials, or opinion columns, or local advertising for actual news reporting, while these sources have none of the integrity, ethics, or principles of actual journalists. It has tarnished true journalism, made people distrustful of the news, and makes it difficult to shut down misinformation and lies before they become widespread."

2021-08-12T13:08:28Z,"Floridians if you love your children and yourselves there is no better time to choose between your lives and Desantis. Would you rather die  or be safe by wearing masks, getting vaccinated and taking precautions?"
2021-08-12T13:07:41Z,These LITTLE MEN who follow Trump are the problem...Christians should totally be against these evil and ignorant people...
2021-08-12T13:06:34Z,DuhSantis is evil.
2021-08-12T13:06:26Z,"DeSatan goal is not the health and safety of Floridians, he knows what&#39;s going on in FL but he&#39;s playing his evil cards, our hospitals are understaffed, out of oxygen, stress, and all because of his &quot;Freedom&quot; no mask, no vaccination...Crazy situation!"
2021-08-12T13:06:04Z,Don&#39;t Falsie my Florida.
2021-08-12T13:05:53Z,Nobody I mean Nobody is Listening To Florida Guy. Cause He Never been a Governor. Listening to those 20 people cheering him on 🤣🤣🤣
2021-08-12T13:05:23Z,He has shovel in hand.  Just keep digging the hole DeathSantis.  This never should have been political.
2021-08-12T13:05:22Z,I&#39;m down with more dead republicans

2021-08-12T13:02:50Z,"Because of the great teacher ( loser trump ) de santis got , he will soon be writing his own book which he will title &quot; THE ART OF SELF DESTRUCTING &quot; , you have to be a complete moron not to see the permanent damage he is doing to himself because he does not care about the damage to Floridians ! ! !"
2021-08-12T13:02:39Z,"I wonder if we would have named the vaccine after former president Trump like Geraldo Rivera proposed on November of 2020?<br>Would that have been a reverse affect, where more Trump supporters would have been the first in line to get Trumped, like Geraldo said. <br>If it solves the issue of having the remaining population to get vaccinated, why not?"
2021-08-12T13:02:35Z,Blah blah fake news
2021-08-12T13:03:28Z,Yet here you are.
2021-08-12T13:01:18Z,And yet...Ron Desantis and his family and the people working around him are vaccinated...😦😦😦🤔🤔🤔
2021-08-12T17:31:15Z,And his kids will be wearing masks in school…
2021-08-12T17:55:21Z,Freakin Hypo kritte
2021-08-12T18:52:03Z,"Yep. And it is required not a choice. By the time Covid and DeSantis are finished with Florida and the political stance, there will not be enough Republicans left to ever win an election again."
2021-08-12T18:55:26Z,"@@rickdfw5005 Good!<br><br>I&#39;ve no problems with many conservatives (on both sides), however, the extremists are what I deem the most dangerous. As they tend to address their mis/disinformations to the most vulnerable and feeble minded citizens."
2021-08-12T18:58:28Z,"@@rickdfw5005 I think there will be many more with short and long term disability than death. Which I understand they don&#39;t care about, but imagine the quality of life of millions they are willing to sacrifice for a kult."
2021-08-12T13:01:15Z,The Republican Party needs to disband.
2021-08-12T12:59:59Z,Florida and other HIGH RISK STATES NEED TO BE QUARANTINED From other States
2021-08-12T23:21:39Z,"i agree, maybe with a wall with Mexico will help.."
2021-08-13T00:29:36Z,"I live in FL. It becomes more frightening each day. We have no leadership. Just a trump-want-to-be who cares more abt his political future than dy!ng constituents, especially Our children."
2021-08-12T12:59:55Z,"Prime example,why we should remove qualified immunity from politicians. He has choosen political b.s. instead of reality...causing people in his state to die. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!WHERE IS THE JUSTICE!!!!"
2021-08-12T12:59:55Z,The fact that I am more likely to get COVID just because I live in Florida really sucks
2021-08-12T12:59:03Z,He does nothing while Floridians get infected and Die. He did not even know that there was a request to the Federal Government for VENTILATORS how totally removed from reality is he. Without masks in schools they will definitely have to close again.
2021-08-12T12:58:56Z,"his goal is to outdo trump in all possible ways.If he can do it, I could do it better( or worst )"
2021-08-12T12:58:48Z,were just ignore he just said illegal aliens are bringing covid <br>that&#39;s racist &quot;ding&quot;
2021-08-12T12:58:30Z,Deathsantis is killing people in Florida and now he&#39;s taking aim at the children in Florida and so called parents are helping him to do it.<br>What kind of mentally ill parent would not want their child protected?<br>What kind of mentally ill parent would put politics before their childs health.
2021-08-12T12:56:13Z,"The threats and ignorance is tiring, but when this sad tRump clone runs in 2024 he will campaign on this stupidity.<br>And half the audience will pump their fists."
2021-08-12T12:55:10Z,The likes of Deathsantis should be jointly charged with negligent manslaughter for the ~400k excess covid-19 deaths they have caused in the USA.
2021-08-12T12:55:08Z,Sue Desantis!
2021-08-12T12:54:56Z,Running Florida into the ground? What a laugh!  People are moving TO Florida. Not the other way around!
2021-08-12T12:54:38Z,"The only way to EVEN try to reason this out is this: some guy.:Deathsantis just invested in a body bag manufacturing company, together with mobile refrigerated MORGUES in Floridaaaaaa!!"
2021-08-12T12:54:04Z,"Then again MSNBCs hero and man of the hour is Cuomo...killer of thousands of older folks and the continuation of communist control over a state, now lost.  Lost to communism but wait.....Not Lost by held in abeyance....Americanism is rising and running these communist propagators to the firing wall."
2021-08-12T12:54:04Z,Desatan is a complete tool
2021-08-12T12:53:56Z,"All Republicans GOP should be forced to live in Florida!  Oooops, I forgot those hypocrites got the vaccine while discouraging their supporters to get the vaccine.  Homicidal maniacs is what they are!"
2021-08-12T12:53:17Z,Florida and DeSantis ..... they absolutely deserve each other.
2021-08-12T12:51:26Z,Dr Faucci being riddiculed is gutter politics - plenty of dead people trusted DeSantis over Dr Faucci - remember that COVID can be a life sentence that may affect the young for the remainder of their lives - not a concern to DeSantis
2021-08-12T12:50:55Z,"The question I have is are the people of Florida still on board with him, or are they turning yet.  In the past I would not have questioned it, but I seem to have overestimated our people in the last few years."
2021-08-12T12:48:10Z,Little Ronnie always wanted to be the King of the World!
2021-08-12T12:47:35Z,Ron Desantis is literally practicing child sacrifice for his political career.
2021-08-12T12:47:15Z,"As an American of Cuban ethniticity, I&#39;m proud to live in Florida and of Desantis. If you want to talk about Covid failures, talk about how Cuomo murdered 15,000 people in nursing homes and how totalitarian a lot of other governors/mayors became, and the hypocrisy of themselves not following their own restrictions. As a good example of recent hypocrisy, look at the maskless bday party Obama had (it&#39;s ok because their sophisticated), but the bikefest is Sturgess is a &quot;super-spreader event.&quot; <br>Mandating an experimental vaccine is wrong and vaccine passports is wrong. My medical history is nobody&#39;s business and I refuse to show my &quot;papers&quot; just to live a normal lifestyle. I refuse to give up my freedoms and right to privacy, just for a little bit of security, because then I would deserve neither. I refuse to let the sacrifices my family made to leave a dictatorship to come to America, just to have one installed here.<br>Also Desantis is not anti-covid vaxx, especially since he got the shot. He tells people repeatedly in press conferences that if you can get it, get it. There is a plethera of places you can go in FL to get the shot. If people want or don&#39;t want to get it, than that is ultimately their choice. He is just anti-vaccine passports and pro letting parents choose what is best for THEIR kids.<br>This commentator is using fear and sensationalization to keep people in a constant state of fear and anger for ratings. Go live your lifes! You&#39;ll be glad that you did."
2021-08-12T12:46:56Z,"This Florida Governor is a complete failure!  And he wants to be President?  He will be voted out!  Go ahead and stick with Trump and his MAGA base, the sane people are the majority."
2021-08-12T12:46:51Z,It is time to sue those fools for the deaths they have caused.
2021-08-12T12:44:25Z,Ron DeathSentence ☠️ strikes again!
2021-08-12T12:44:07Z,Criminal GOP politician.  His future is limited. One should not forget that under educated Floridians voted him into office.
2021-08-12T12:42:44Z,It just shows you you don&#39;t have to be smart to hold public office.
2021-08-12T12:42:34Z,Did that “son of a bum” even go to school? How did he get elected?
2021-08-12T12:41:29Z,Don’t offend second grade. They think at a higher level than that.
2021-08-12T12:39:57Z,Wide open border well wide open Florida and i see kids in icu you moron desantis
2021-08-12T12:39:50Z,"We love visiting the FL Theme Parks, however, NO, I WON&#39;T GO !   We were trying to go this fall or winter.  It&#39;s not going to happen."
2021-08-12T12:39:02Z,This has to do with something more than covid this guy is hiding something.
2021-08-12T12:39:01Z,He’s doing it all for political reasons .  He is playing with our lives he will never ever be president as he wishes one day bcd he’s loosing many followers
2021-08-12T12:38:32Z,"I warned everyone last February that the Republicans wanted to use our children as lab rats. <br>Well, here we are…"
2021-08-12T12:38:20Z,All of man&#39;s wickedness and evil within their hearts will be laid bare before God and no man will have a valid defense of the evil which he has chosen. Nothing is hidden from His sight and He will judge the hearts of mankind.
2021-08-12T12:38:16Z,Children don&#39;t vote republican.
2021-08-12T12:37:46Z,"Why why why o why you guys are so screwed up....and yet you keep trump, the gop and this piece of s*<b>*</b> work"
2021-08-12T12:37:16Z,Ron Desantis is encouraging this turmoil by politicizing the pandemic and mask-wearing.  He wants to foment disorder and anarchy in his state because he thinks it will make him more appealing to his base and Trump and help him politically. Some leader huh?
2021-08-12T12:36:52Z,He doesn’t care about the people in his state . And it has nothings to do with the media the words are coming out of his mouth!!  Masks work he’s still going over this ??? Who talking about a lock down it’s all just BS to fund raising he’s despicable. What a low life !!  Wait until there’s another Hurricane people have to wait in those evaluation centers COVID will be ramp and more than it is now.  He’s another politician with narcissistic personality disorder he doesn’t care about anybody but himself
2021-08-12T12:35:41Z,"fun fact<br>according to CDC data; 01Feb2020-01Jul2021<br>there have been 55.8k +/- 2.4k excess deaths in FL as compared to an official covid-19 death toll of &quot;just&quot; 35.2k. That&#39;s 58% more than the official tally <br>That is, one excess death every 385 Floridians as compared to a US national average of one every 445 Americans. <br>And, there is evidence DeSantis is hiding a few thousand extra deaths in the swamps"
2021-08-12T12:57:59Z,"@@les5136 unfortunately there are a couple of caveats in your reasoning. One, there is at least a million people who can&#39;t get vaccinated for whatever medical reason, even though they would like to. two, the virus mortality is indeed too low to make any significant dent in conservative electorate numbers. Besides, conservatives have been withholding power for decades despite being already a significant minority, thanks to a biased electoral system and rules bending."
2021-08-12T12:35:09Z,Time to remove all children from MAGA voters to save their precious little lives from abusive reckless parents.

2021-08-12T12:33:02Z,"I like the heading.. DeSantis = mini-trump… well look where trump is today… a LOSER ex-president responsible for 100,000s of of AMERICANS!!! Through his total mishandling of the pandemic at the beginning… looks like DeSantis is following his mentor… LOSER trump..  ex-governor desantis"
2021-08-12T12:32:59Z,Why <i>Fauci Your Florida</i> when you can <i>Funeral Your Florida</i> instead?
2021-08-12T12:32:50Z,Florida and Texas are neck and neck in a battle for the worst governed state in America. ☠👿🥀
2021-08-12T12:32:11Z,DeSantis foolish and arrogant just like Trump...he will publicly fall just like Trump!!!
2021-08-12T12:31:13Z,DeSantis the Impaler......Immensely popular among his people but deadly against those that oppose him or defy him to do what is right.......and the children? Children cant vote...what good are they?
2021-08-12T12:30:54Z,What mini Trump!? 🍄 ⬅️ Mini Trump
2021-08-12T12:30:24Z,This is hilarious. The comment about people not wanting to go to Florida for vacation. We had a family trip booked to go to Oregon and Northern California. We cancelled and rebooked to Florida because it doesn’t require masks and we love DeSantis take on freedom of choice! I have talked to several friends and family and others have done the same thing. States that don’t force masks will get my business. Florida will get my money.
2021-08-12T12:27:28Z,sadly<br> he will be re elected
2021-08-12T12:26:24Z,"Some FL schools are sending notes home, saying now you do not need all those shot to get into schools like the last yrs , WTF"
2021-08-12T12:24:39Z,I wonder if DeSantis is sending his children to school without a mask. I wonder if he even cares if his children are around those that are infected with the virus. We don’t hear anything about that!!!
2021-08-12T12:28:26Z,DeSantis&#39; children attend an expensive private school where masks are required for everyone.
2021-08-12T12:22:58Z,"...i agree with ari... the governor is busy arguing about mask mandate and doing everything in his power to ban mask mandates.. this is tantamount to curtailing freedom/ your personal choice.. why would you not allow people to make that choice..?? i wonder..?? but instead of getting sooo busy talking about mask mandates, which is still very essential, why not provide a plan to make vaccines available to all floridians.. he could use all his energy and power to create a smooth &amp; effective way to getting everyone in Florida getting a vaccine.. this is a much better discussion point than banning mask throughout the state.. he can get his state legislators to create a talking point on how to deliver the vaccines faster and more efficiently, which will in turn trickle to their respective council men for each county.. then he could get his state legislators talk about how to help their overloaded hospitals get their much needed emergency supplies to support the influx of patients from COVID.. they could even send an urgent request to the national stockpile for such supplies, which is properly/ adequately stocked in these items.. they could work with the Federal government agencies and get this health emergency, which is top priority, tamed and behind them.. <br>...&amp; MOST OF ALL, FORGET THE MASK MANDATE FIASCO...!!!"
2021-08-12T12:22:51Z,"He’s right, the media is hysterical, given the low mortality rate and the other alternatives to the current mandates.  And the current administration is allowing 180,000 illegal immigrants over the border per month and flying and bussing them into your communities.<br><br>They’re going after him in earnest now, the purge begins, given that he’s a potential future GOP leader."
2021-08-12T12:22:49Z,Last time DeSantis plays dumb by saying he didn&#39;t know Covid can be asymptomatic.  This time he will say he thought Covid was eliminated.
2021-08-12T12:22:33Z,DeSantis wouldn&#39;t be able to be playing with people&#39;s lives -- <b>childrens</b> lives if he didn&#39;t have support. We can only hope these people wake up to the fact that Covid isn&#39;t about politics &amp; they aren&#39;t only risking their lives -- they are sacrificing their  childrens lives if they continue to support him. He &amp; his loved ones are vaccinated &amp; if they should become infected they will have access to care the public doesn&#39;t.
2021-08-12T12:22:12Z,Why Anyone who loves the Freedom given to us by Almighty God would listen to MSNBC. ABC. NBC. CNN .is beyond my understanding
2021-08-12T12:21:25Z,"Why do people let deszntis away with being a one man virus enabler, it&#39;s madness the guy should be run out of Florida!"
2021-08-12T12:21:25Z,Note one word . Some people is familiar to some media.

HE SUPPOSED to protect and serve his constituents even the little children yet he let his pride and knowing that he could become the next president of the United States to let the children suffer in Florida kick him out the 🚪 !  If he&#39;s just like the former president ?
2021-08-12T12:20:22Z,"The sad thing about this is, that the Trumpets will never see reality, no matter what happens."
2021-08-12T12:20:03Z,Florida voters brought it on them selves by voting and supporting him no sympathy for them at all you love Trump so stop crying
2021-08-12T12:20:02Z,"Oh Ron, your lies and dictates are harming your own citizens.  Time to get over your temper tantrums.  You’re digging your own political grave.  Grow up, DeSantis.  Start caring about your constituents instead of your own belligerence."

2021-08-12T12:12:41Z,Desantis is a Trump wannabe
2021-08-12T12:11:33Z,Why is the federal government trying to help them if it’s obvious that Florida doesn’t want help.?

2021-08-12T12:08:21Z,"How can people like DeSantis, trump and others murder so many people and get away with it, trump murdered into the hundreds of thousands in America then went on to murder 180,000 Kurds that were American allies and topped it off by having more people executed in jails than any other president in history. How are these people still walking around, is this the world we now live in when in history we fought wars to stop people like these and now they are elected to office and paid with fundraising and put on the media as if we are watching a reality Tv show."

The country did all this last year: Skyrocketing cases, overwhelmed medical facilities and staff, rising death rates, quarantines. Then we started wearing masks and got reliable vaccines resulting in reduced rates of cases and deaths. Enter the delta variant. Rinse and repeat.  Pray these people wake up and stop whining in time to prevent the next variant that says &quot;screw your vaccines.&quot; I&#39;d prefer to watch &quot;Groundhog Day,&quot; not live it."

I&#39;m getting out of there.  Head over to New York,  Yea there also.  As the media attack DeSantis and Trump , democrat controlled cities continue to deteriorate . It will be interesting to watch as more on the left and their loved ones become victims of their dear leaders incompetence. There will be a statistical turning point when they will remember the wise words &quot; what have you got to loose &quot; .   They have a lot to loose, and they know it.

2021-08-12T18:29:51Z,Under normal circumstances I would have thought that this would be enough to have Desantis declared mentally incompetent to remain governor.  Where is the lieutenant governor in all this? Do they even still have one?

2021-08-12T10:53:22Z,Have any of these media idiots ever been to Florida?
2021-08-12T10:53:15Z,"DeathSantis is supposed to be a &#39;law and order&#39; guy. Well, he passes laws and orders dinner. Of course instead of letting local officials (you know - small government) do what&#39;s needed in their respective areas, he passes down BIG GOVERNMENT laws. There&#39;s no doubt in my mind that DeathSantis and Trump have really mixed up their followers. Oh, and killed off a bunch also. <br><br>Personally, I believe that DeathSantis&#39; and Trump&#39;s followers should absolutely go mask-less and vaccination-less. And, when they show up sick at the Hospitals they should be turned away. Why should the Hospitals help those who refuse to help themselves? Hopefully, the GOP&#39;s supporters will catch the virus and die, further reducing the number of Fascist Nazis in the State of Florida. The fewer Nazis we have the better off we all are....<br><br>Now, as DeathSantis&#39; numbers continue to fall off I expect to hear a lot more whining, crying, and blaming of others for his downfall just like his daddy Trump does. No way it&#39;s the big bad powerful GOP governor&#39;s fault. It has to be the fault of someone who has no power to do anything about it, like all those black and brown people. No way DeathSantis is going to take credit for his own actions. Which, for some reason,  seems to be typical conservative behavior now days.<br><br> And, to all those parents who are going to send their kids to school with out masks, I say you are either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid. But, I&#39;ll make a bet that DeathSantis&#39; kids are well protected. I bet no one goes around them unvaccinated or unmasked."
2021-08-12T10:52:45Z,DeSantistize  FL at next election.  FIRED like Don for mishandling Covid. Same for  Tate Boy in Mississippi.Hospitals there overwhelmed. Just listened MD a largest MS Hospital..Tate also never followed the science..FIRE BOTH OF THEM. This did not need to happen even with highly contagious DELTA  Variant.
2021-08-12T10:50:51Z,"Very sad times for Florida. I strongly and agree, he is after, and think he is attacking and punishing Joe Biden for winning the 2020 elections. He is very, very angry and has found a way he thinks to avenge the Democratic party. In the process, he is right before every body&#39; s eyes,  openly sacrificing innocent lives, including the lives of precious children who cannot even vote yet. <br>Where is the LAW for this crime on humanity???????<br>The courts needs to STOP this MAN, NOW, NOW, NOW, please someone needs to step in and stop this. So sad.<br>  The people also need to vote him out.<br>Are they waiting for half of Florida&#39;s population to succumb to Covid- 19 first???"

2021-08-12T10:46:38Z,DeSantis only concern is politics and to further his role in government. How sad this man could care less how many people in his state will die. I applaud the areas who are going against this governor. He is truly a Mini-Trump wanna be.
2021-08-12T10:46:32Z,Why is the virus 🦠 only real when it’s the immigrants who have it? ... Open your eyes 👀 people save yourselves..
2021-08-12T10:45:50Z,"If Desantes keeps going this way, he will have murdered his voter base, through inaction. In times of war, we make sacrifices for the common good. This is such a time. He could become a hero, by encouraging people to where masks, socially distance, limit their movements and get vaccinated. Not only would he be credited with saving thousands of lives, he would set himself up as a stark alternative to Trump and his crazy agenda. Politically, he’s missing an opportunity to shine. As a human being, he’s proving that he will do anything to appeal to the ult-right, conspiracy theorist elements of society. I believe he’s backed the wrong horse."

He KNOWS that he’s killing children and he’s doing it on purpose. You know how I know that he knows? His kids go to a private school with a mask mandate and he hasn’t made a peep about it.

He knows when a governor of a state runs for president, his state will vote for him regardless of his his performance good or bad. Hes needs to look good to the other republicans of all the states to win. I&#39;m fairly certain that he wont mind losing a few florins life&#39;s to make him president, would just be a matter of collateral damage."

2021-08-12T10:08:48Z,"Simple answer for those who dismiss Covid. Get them to sign away their health coverage for Covid related issues. If they get sick, they don&#39;t get to use medical services such as a hospital bed, a ventilator, the care of a doctor or nurse. If you choose to drive without insurance, you accept the consequences if you get in an accident. If you don&#39;t protect yourself (wear a mask, get the vaccine) against Covid then surely you are doing the same. Ultimately, it would never happen as medical staff are too dedicated and would never turn a sick person away but it may be a good conversation starting point with those that follow these absurd ideas."

No kickbacks for biden? No illegal income from his sons illegal doings ? DeSantis is simply saying you are not allowed to tell people what to do. He hasn&#39;t told anyone not to wear a mask. He hasn&#39;t told anyone not to get a &quot; vaccine &quot;. Letting people choose what to do is now not right? But telling people what to do is ok? A &quot; vaccinated &quot; person wearing a mask can be infected with covid and can spread covid. An &quot; unvaccinated &quot; person can get covid and spread covid. An &quot; unvaccinated &quot; person not wearing a mask is &quot; dangerous &quot; to a &quot; vaccinated &quot; person wearing a mask? No. They are not. A person who chose to get a shot should not be concerned about a person who chooses not to. Only how sick you may get is all the shot is doing. It does not prevent the spread of covid. DeSantis letting people choose is not harming anyone. It&#39;s such a warped perception to believe that&#39;s what&#39;s happening.

For the last forty years we have repeatedly lower taxes on wealthy people with the middle class losing ground.  With the citizens united decision wealthy donors have gotten even more control of congress passing legislation favorable to corporations and wealthy people.  In the mean time all six major news media are controlled by wealthy people who distract us with abortion, immigrants, guns, militarism, racism while they rob us blind.  Trumpism is lashing out by the middle class as they are losing ground.  Why not follow the pied piper when you have no control over the situation."

2021-08-12T20:02:12Z,You will be surprised the idiots that will …SMH
2021-08-12T20:07:50Z,"What’s worse is this clown still thinks he can ride the trump wave to the whitehouse?  he has the charisma of moldy dry toast, he seriously thinks he still has a shot lol The trump playbook and boisterous approach only works for trump, not this frumpy faced mope, looks constipated every day. He and rand Paul are the biggest softies….I’m sure their ancestors back in the Middle Ages were part of local govt in Europe and were bubonic plague “deniers”"
2021-08-12T22:18:39Z,I will never go there.
2021-08-12T08:03:20Z,Republicans can’t lie their way around the grim reality of Covid. Death is hard to fake.
2021-08-12T08:03:04Z,De Santis is too busy persuing his political career to take care of his State. MAGA-get shut of HIM.
2021-08-12T08:02:56Z,To Americans the world is only  black/white; there&#39;s no nuances or shades.
2021-08-12T08:02:43Z,He will get his karma
2021-08-12T08:02:39Z,DeSantis is a blessing for Democrats.
2021-08-12T08:01:32Z,I KNOW THIS CLOWN DOESN&#39;T BELIEVE THE PROPAGANDA THAT HE&#39;S SPEWING🤦🏿
2021-08-12T08:01:00Z,The house is on fire.<br><br>Guv: &quot;I will arrest any fire fighter.....&quot;
2021-08-12T11:26:51Z,Well said..
2021-08-12T14:17:49Z,Touche~
2021-08-12T16:01:25Z,brilliant analogy!
2021-08-12T18:03:07Z,Lawson-- you are 100 % correct!!!!!
2021-08-12T23:40:03Z,That makes so much sense.  It&#39;s very comparable to what DeSantis is doing here in Florida.
2021-08-12T07:59:29Z,&quot;Mini-trump&quot; kind of implies that the original has some stature that has room to shrink. tRump is too tiny to have a &#39;mini&#39;.<br>I prefer Dumpster 2.0
2021-08-12T10:43:28Z,You must be a spec of dust in relation
2021-08-12T16:41:38Z,@@knovafly6879 That&#39;s the size of your brain.
2021-08-12T19:36:14Z,@@nomdeguerre247 haha you still think brain size equates to intelligence don’t you?
2021-08-12T20:52:58Z,"@@knovafly6879 In your case it does, smooth and tiny 🧠"
2021-08-12T07:58:56Z,Another poor man&#39;s trump like Brazil&#39;s leader...bozo bolsonaroo
2021-08-12T07:58:44Z,"Hard to imagine the Republican motive. Incidentally, black Americans are twice as likely to die from COVID-19. Something to think about."
2021-08-12T08:14:13Z,"It may be part of the reason they&#39;re happy to let the virus spread, and they don&#39;t care who else gets swept away too. Evil criminals."
2021-08-12T07:58:43Z,DeSatan is also literally killing children in Florida too!!
2021-08-12T07:58:19Z,Like forest&#39;s moma said stupid is as stupid dose . I can&#39;t  wait to see what these deranged Republicans come up with next . I just hope we all survive it.
2021-08-12T07:58:03Z,"... looking at the map, it is rather sad to listen to Floridians not realizing they have nowhere to run but wake up and vaccinate... unless Mr. Jesus decide to intervene on their behalf... <br>fat chance of that happening, I&#39;d say..."
2021-08-12T07:57:48Z,What if the parents want masking. Will DeSantis support their rights?
2021-08-12T07:57:37Z,Desantis is the new face of IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY. He can  create an alternate reality and Fox News can help him maintain it!!!
2021-08-12T07:56:55Z,Dead people can’t vote but I’m sure De Satan will fix that.
2021-08-12T07:55:30Z,"Theory, experience, common sense  -  nothing is good enough for this egomaniac goon.  DeSantis&#39; slogan is: I heard it through the grapevine."
2021-08-12T07:55:19Z,THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA WAS SPEAKING NOTHING BUT TRUTH!
2021-08-12T07:53:47Z,"hey, if Trump able to took away more than 500,000 lives during his failed pandemic handling, this Mini - Trump could took at least 50,000 floridian lives, young or old."
2021-08-12T07:52:44Z,DeSantis comments makes me think he hasn&#39;t bothered to visit hospitals in Florida or maybe he&#39;s just in denial just like his mentor Trump.Maybe he just can&#39;t learn or has no care for children.
2021-08-12T07:50:51Z,DUH-SANTIS strikes again
2021-08-12T07:50:47Z,Pure evil
2021-08-12T07:50:34Z,DeSantis is a Sadistic Lunatic.
2021-08-12T07:49:51Z,"What happened to &quot;America, Land of the Free...&quot; DeSantis is DICTATING to the People he was elected to PROTECT! The Hospitals are full to overflowing with Covid patients and having to get help from the Federal Government because DeSantis is neglecting the duty.  Now he&#39;s denying the youth in his State, a healthy, safe education...  All for Fame, self empowerment and self enrichment.<br><br>He couldn&#39;t keep his nose out of the Champlain Towers Disaster even though the Lady Mayor and her Staff had organising and were overseeing everything that had to be done. What State wide Mandates has he put in place with regard to building safety so that this never happens again?<br><br>He hasn&#39;t got a clue about how to run a state, he&#39;s a total waste of time and space."
2021-08-12T07:49:44Z,"My question is, how can they go on with their lives?"
2021-08-12T07:45:55Z,Floridians need to get wise and do the right thing.  Florida is full of none sense and idiotic thinking.   Get out of the way.  Stupidity is bliss.
2021-08-12T07:44:39Z,DeSantis just cares about getting political donations from the Trump supporters.  The health of Floridians simply does not matter to him.
2021-08-12T07:43:38Z,Florida is a trump state correct?well its the perfect place for the virus to rage.hopefully texas is right behind .then Iowa
2021-08-12T07:42:57Z,"The only thing Ron Desantis did wrong, according to liberals, is to stop mandatory vaccine passports right? Fascism is growing among liberals"
2021-08-12T07:39:24Z,"It&#39;s hard for me to feel sorry for these people, if this is the kind of people you elect to run your state this is what you get."
2021-08-12T07:38:54Z,"poor, poor Florida!  He&#39;s killing off his own voters...He&#39;s cruel and stupid."
2021-08-12T07:38:17Z,You people are such nasty liars!  But we all know how you work. Anyone who has a mind of his own &amp; a very good one you do as always!! ATTACK
2021-08-12T07:38:13Z,"This ignorance governor thinks children in FL are just the lambs that needed to be sacrificed, so he can stay in power. For any parent who supported him, pls thinks really careful about his motive for banning mask mandate in school when your kids who are under 12 yr of age, are not eligible for vaccines. Delta Variants are spreading and your child is vulnerable to this deadly virus. So protect your child should be your most important duty as a parent. I wouldn’t give glib about what this guy said."
2021-08-12T07:35:29Z,Desantis is 🔥💩🗑
2021-08-12T07:34:03Z,If dasantis did Gods will he would of had a chance!
2021-08-12T07:33:47Z,I alone am right - Deathsantis
2021-08-12T07:33:43Z,Lol build back better....can&#39;t get any more stupid than that. Uncle Joe got a problem 70 IQ. Numbers game aside
2021-08-12T07:33:38Z,I guarantee he&#39;s not just letting his kids go to school without mask. Florida need to start a recall to get rid of him.
2021-08-12T07:32:55Z,So where in your holy constitution does it say you have the right to endanger other people’s lives?
2021-08-12T07:31:15Z,His t-shirt stupid Let&#39;s start by recognizing that is not Ron De Satan&#39;s Florida its the American people and his  job is to protect them . And put them  1st not his paycheck.
2021-08-12T07:30:51Z,Isn&#39;t this close to crimes against humanity? Leaders have been hanged for less...
2021-08-12T07:30:27Z,Every death in Florida should be blame to mini trump de santis. I hope he will catch the deadliest virus to teach him a lesson he won’t forget. He is delusional crazy like his cult leader orange boy.
2021-08-12T07:30:25Z,Would really like to know why it is this bad during the summer when 70% of Florida&#39;s population is vaccinated??
2021-08-12T07:27:14Z,"He learned his governing techniques from the leader of his Cuba, Castro!"
2021-08-12T07:26:52Z,"Meanwhile I just saw on progressives news that MAGGOTS are flocking to south Florida either to live, buy summer homes? They want to turn the entire state red? Well they&#39;ll be dead not red first!"
2021-08-12T07:26:40Z,"Can people in Florida tell me, are there any talks to recall this guy?"
2021-08-12T07:24:59Z,"If they were countries, the numbers for Florida and Texas would put them at the forefront of the pandemic across the globe."
2021-08-12T07:24:05Z,The only thing Ron De Satan  is standing in the way of its progress of the American people and our values of a better  life in Florida and the country
2021-08-12T07:23:45Z,Dumbsantis is practicing population control. He doesnt like people.
2021-08-12T07:22:02Z,How much has Fauci been paid for the use of his name on merch?
2021-08-12T07:20:48Z,"He was wrong the first time around and people died,  he&#39;s wrong this time but he cares even less than he did before. He&#39;s playing politics with the lives of children now. He is a CRIMINAL !!"
2021-08-12T07:19:08Z,Hmmm...maybe I&#39;ll get in business and start selling &quot;Don&#39;t DeSantis My America&quot; tee shirts.
2021-08-12T07:19:07Z,Deathsantis this is Jim Jones on steroids these Red State governors are unfit to hold office the other guy&#39;s party is insane.
2021-08-12T07:18:44Z,Some Republicans are making their party into a cult sacrificing Americans for the political gain and for a paycheck and then they call themselves pro-&quot;life&quot; party  they are Patriots? God fearing? Please 🖕
2021-08-12T07:18:38Z,"DeMoRon DeSantis, true spawn of Drumpfenstein&#39;s Monster Donny."
2021-08-12T07:17:09Z,I guess that Florida&#39;s governor doesn&#39;t understand that there&#39;s no other countries with borders with Florida I  suppose DESANTIS doesn&#39;t know how to read a map
2021-08-12T07:15:42Z,What an utter bell-end
2021-08-12T07:15:03Z,&quot;There&#39;s a killer on the road&quot; Ron Deathsantis
2021-08-12T17:31:50Z,The Red Death rides again.
2021-08-12T18:25:32Z,"Desantis,.  Just another victim of &quot;roadkill&quot;?  At the polls?"
2021-08-12T07:12:37Z,DeSantis is part of the death cult.<br>Don&#39;t listen to him.
2021-08-12T07:12:20Z,Is this dude a Russian operative? I&#39;m being totally serious.
2021-08-12T07:35:06Z,blackmailed? Most likely IMHO
2021-08-12T07:11:36Z,The hospitals wouldn&#39;t be so overwhelmed if he took any measures to mitigate spread.
2021-08-12T07:11:09Z,Florida leader ron has his tie on to tight and can&#39;t think properly. Is he employed by fox news?
2021-08-12T07:07:58Z,"Humans with a soul might feel guilt; but  DeSantis isn’t human and doesn’t have a soul.  What a loser…oh wait he is a Trump mini me, so of course he’s a loser"
2021-08-12T07:07:54Z,There must be times when DeSantis goes home and ask himself why he is doing what he is doing.
2021-08-12T07:07:46Z,He learned nothing from Trump&#39;s collosal failure and subsequent landslide loss.
2021-08-12T07:07:21Z,"He has none of the “charisma” of Trump, his political career will be over soon."
2021-08-12T07:01:44Z,DeSantis 2024 - Make Corona Great Again
2021-08-12T07:00:06Z,Shut the TV off and go live a normal life!!!
2021-08-12T06:58:57Z,Survival of the fittest
2021-08-12T06:58:56Z,Desantis is TRASH!!!!
2021-08-12T06:56:51Z,DEATHsantis killing children!!!<br>Why can’t we LOCK HIM UP?!?!?
2021-08-12T06:56:43Z,Crazy. Lives should matter more than politics.
2021-08-12T06:55:51Z,"Just another day, here in Florida."
2021-08-12T06:55:15Z,Florida will need to build crematoriums and cemeteries for the unvaccinated tourists.
2021-08-12T06:52:37Z,Don’t DeSantis my America!
2021-08-12T06:51:09Z,"ALL FLUS or viruses,  TRAVEL,, you cannot stop  it,  and we have  380 TRILLION VIRUSES IN OUR  BODIES,, think of  that,,,,,  you probably dont know what a VIrus  is,,, most dont,,,,,,,,,,,,cheers to you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Polio virus is TRANSMITTED thru FECES,  not  the  virus per  se,,,,,, cheers to  all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

This is what happens when a 🌋 volcano meets a tornado.  You don&#39;t get another chance life is not a Nintendo game.🤔"
2021-08-12T06:49:33Z,Pole dancing for tips. This is the cheapest show on the strand. He gives back alley fluffy for donations too.

2021-08-12T06:48:03Z,DeSantis is more dangerous than Donald Trump because he has the same mindset of Trump without the reputation of Trump’s craziness. DeSantis has graduated from Ivy League schools but has dummied down for political money and power and does not care that the Feds had to send 100 ventilators to Florida.
2021-08-12T06:48:00Z,"Just like a spoilt child, blame everyone, and everything else for the problem. In fact, it is you, Mr DeSantis, that has caused the problems."
2021-08-12T06:46:58Z,"The Florida moron certainly learned well the former guy’s skills, Killing unnecessarily as many as possible."
2021-08-12T17:33:06Z,LIKE CUOMOS NURSING HOME PATIENTS?
2021-08-12T06:46:13Z,Children and people are dying...
2021-08-12T06:45:04Z,"Yes we love our freedom, but we still need law and order because this is our country without it right now!"
2021-08-12T06:47:49Z,"It isn&#39;t about freedom, it is about public health."
2021-08-12T06:42:07Z,Floridians need to totally ignore DeSantis and do what is best to combat the virus to get it under control.   DeSantis is not sane.
2021-08-12T06:36:33Z,"Get over yourselves. I have a mate in florida, he has no problem, his family, no problem, so on and so forth.<br>&#39;Mini trump&#39;. Pff, the guys been out of office for half a year, try something new, jesus."
2021-08-12T06:36:28Z,"at least the t shirt is accurate, because florida is bright red, as the covid map is"
2021-08-12T06:36:09Z,He is just like Trump. Killing Americans for his own political agenda
2021-08-12T06:35:00Z,I thought the Gov had an Ivy league education....He must have gotten in as a legacy admission because he is clearly a dunce!
2021-08-12T06:34:55Z,Ari is great at sarcasm - love it
2021-08-12T06:34:10Z,"A quick message from a friend across the pond, my sister in law almost died from covid, I&#39;ve lost friends and neighbors, you have my sympathy, it&#39;s hard enough battling the disease but these lunatics who supposedly are elected to serve you, can&#39;t believe what&#39;s happened to America."
2021-08-12T19:18:55Z,Many of us also blame the not so bright people who voted them in.
2021-08-12T19:36:33Z,Thank you for that and so sorry for your lost at least she is with the lord don&#39;t worry she is smiling at you right now GOD BLESS YOU
2021-08-12T06:33:06Z,Welcome to the America that Trump created...Utter Chaos &amp; Madness
2021-08-12T06:32:57Z,200 ventilators...to a state of 10s of millions of people....tons of help there Joe.
2021-08-12T12:16:09Z,"You mean those ventilators De Santis hasn’t asked for and doesn’t care about because according to him, there is no problem in Florida. Why do you care? HE doesn’t. He said so and didn’t know that ventilators were desperately needed in his state…"
2021-08-12T06:31:57Z,So this is probably their best attack strat with Desantis. Call him another Trump so they can treat him as such. Not bad. Although Desantis will attack back much much much better. Dude is a Harvard Grad.
2021-08-12T06:30:40Z,"It&#39;s nice to hear newscasters call out these irresponsible Republicans, instead of just reporting what they say."
2021-08-12T06:28:46Z,Wait till COVID slaughters all of DeSantis family . Then we&#39;ll see the type of Fear Mongering he does .
2021-08-12T06:28:00Z,This is fake news.
2021-08-12T06:27:43Z,"It’s easy to present yourself as talking rear end and not thinking how selfish that is, all in the name off freedom. The freedom denied from the again overwhelmed healthcare takers, that are the real jobs that take the toll of stupid arguments."
2021-08-12T06:27:35Z,Covid loves DeSantis
2021-08-12T06:25:07Z,I am grateful I don&#39;t live in Florida but dang Texas isn&#39;t any better!
2021-08-12T06:24:52Z,Just sad
2021-08-12T06:24:38Z,You are the best do not let stupid reporters that are sitting on there brsins
2021-08-12T06:23:02Z,"What&#39;s in it for this man.. It must be money, money ...what else ... Harvard, Yale has taught him nothing ... what a j**k ..."
2021-08-12T06:22:41Z,OMG… What is wrong with that guy did his mother drop him on his head?
2021-08-12T06:22:31Z,"When your child is forced to attend in-school learning without vaccination, who picks up the costs for CoViD recovery if you child needs an organ transplant? Who picks up the tab if your child gets COPD and requires an oxygen machine for life? Who picks up the tab for the years of pain related to cardiovascular damage caused by the virus? Parents need to demand emergency vaccine use for their children. They need to keep them from attending in-school learning until the states fight for their children over business pocketbooks."
2021-08-12T17:36:21Z,It’s being made political.. and the expense of children  and you are so right!!
2021-08-12T19:20:47Z,NOT the repukingtons.
2021-08-12T19:49:48Z,"Even if they did, these same people fighting make will fight getting their kids vaccinated. At some point the vaccine isn&#39;t going to help at all due to all the variants and who knows when or if we&#39;ll get a new vaccine. My husband and I can&#39;t have kids, but if we did, I would be scared for them. I love in a red country on a red state and people won&#39;t wear masks. They still fly their Trump flags high. It&#39;s the long term effects that people who are lucky enough to recover will have to deal with. Why would anyone subject an innocent child to a possible lifetime of health problems? Why would anyone take medical advice from a politician? I don&#39;t understand. Where&#39;s the proof in their claims that the vaccine kills, that their injecting people trackers? If it was created and released on purpose, then how about we deal with the virus now and then we can dream with those that did the alleged crime?"
2021-08-12T21:06:23Z,@Crittermama 😾You are so right on all points.
2021-08-12T21:16:15Z,Your child will be fine its not that serious
2021-08-12T06:18:52Z,after the DeathSantis babel ... the comment &quot;Stupid&quot; bout sums it up ...
2021-08-12T06:18:27Z,Floridians Safety First please!
2021-08-12T06:18:19Z,"Desantis is nothing but an evil,  hateful demon.💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀"
2021-08-12T06:17:51Z,"&quot;I can&#39;t breathe, Ron&quot;"
2021-08-12T06:17:27Z,Governor Death&#39;Santis will soon have no voters left in the state. Doesn&#39;t he realize it&#39;s his voters who are dying?
2021-08-12T06:17:12Z,he sounds more and more like Trump babbling on and on to cover the obvious failures ... deaths ...
2021-08-12T06:15:49Z,"And just imagine - Trump still being president - this would be every State here would look like a war zone -  this is Trump politics people - let the people have their freedom let them die, - &quot;It is what it is&quot;"
2021-08-12T06:14:53Z,whats wrong with this guy. so ignorant
2021-08-12T06:12:56Z,Ron DeSatan is worse than the mayor from Jaws.
2021-08-12T06:12:20Z,"He is Republican. That means if you tell him he screwed up he will double down, which he did. Now you turn up the heat and he will triple down. That is their Modus Operandi. Ooops, they don&#39;t teach that term in Florida&#39;s second grade."
2021-08-12T06:11:51Z,So instead we’re gonna go back to polluting with tanker ships bringing oil in from other countries.... so pay more money pollute more and politicians pockets get lined
2021-08-12T06:11:07Z,The residents of Florida need to recall DeathSantis! He is killing them with Covid just to benefit his sick twisted political career. He is a monster!
2021-08-12T06:08:56Z,"Governor of Florida DeSantis is guilty of homicidal malfeasance. People including many children are getting very sick, and filling up ICUs. He is allowing the virus to spread and helping it to mutate too. This is negligence and HE is liable."
2021-08-12T06:07:55Z,"Give it a couple more weeks, this Delta or Gamma whatever it is will vanished in thin air and no one will ever talked about it anymore. Don’t believe me? Do some researches, because that happened in England and across Europe"
2021-08-12T06:07:05Z,&quot;I died needlessly.... but at least I never wore a mask!&quot;  (Cut off your nose.... to spite your face?)   &quot;Thsmart&quot; choice!

The current thinking on this is that we will not attain herd immunity because of the Delta variant, and given how Covid mutates, the next variant might well be unstoppable.

2021-08-12T04:31:46Z,"Between 12 Mar 2020 and 11 Aug 2020 there were 546,093 cases, and 10,970 deaths in Florida, due to covid19.<br>Between 12 Mar 2021 and 11 Aug 2021 there were 886,683 cases, and 6,974 deaths in Florida, due to covid19.<br><br>In 2020, the upswing in cases began around 8 Jun, and peaked around 17 Jul (with about 11,000 cases per day).<br>In 2021, the upswing in cases began around 8 Jul, and has not peaked (currently with about 24,000 cases per day).<br>That is a full month difference in timing, and a very large difference in daily cases.<br><br>In 2020, deaths in Florida began to tic upward about 28 Jun, peaking around 4 Aug at about 220 per day (that&#39;s a lot of people dying each day).<br>In 2021, deaths in Florida began to tic upward about 15 Jul, has not peaked yet, with about 60 deaths currently per day (still a lot of people dying each day).<br><br>In Florida, under Ron DeSantis&#39; (un)leadership, over 2,849,000 Floridians have been infected with covid19 (3rd highest total number of cases, and 7th highest number of cases per unit of population - out of 50 states) - AND - over 40,170 Floridians have died from covid19 (4th highest total deaths, and 25th highest number of deaths per unit of population - out of 50 states). That is, literally, a terrible, terrible reflection and legacy of how Ron DeSantis has continually mismanaged (through willful ignorance and negligent incompetence) a deadly, highly transmissible, viral pandemic. And under his dull-witted attempted at governing, there are going to be many, many more deaths - the worst is yet to come. Disgraceful."

2021-08-12T04:24:08Z,&quot;Never let a good crisis go to waste.&quot; DeSantis is a clever enough politician to recognize a golden opportunity to score points with his base when he sees it.

2021-08-12T04:09:14Z,"Most likely vaccinations will be approved for kids within a couple of months.  That may end this issue, though I suppose it&#39;s possible that DeSantis decides to try and block vaccine mandates even in schools, where they have traditionally been mandated for other diseases.<br><br>I think if I was a school administrator in Florida, I might be exploring the possibility of calling the governor&#39;s bluff on mask mandates and truly let parents decide, just as DeSantis claims to want.  Just make all parents accept for decline on a statement like, &quot;I require that my child wear a mask while at school and authorize the school to enforce my decision on this matter.&quot;  For ease and consistency in implementation, kids are separated into different classes based on the answer.  Separate but equal, of course, though I have little doubt which classes will have all the kids of parents who have an interest in their child&#39;s health and education and the situation that makes teachers want to be closely engaged."

2021-08-12T12:24:26Z,Letting the parents chose opposed to making it a rule will only result in more children showing up to school ready to raise the rate of infection for the entire school and all the households they return to when the school day ends.

2021-08-12T03:40:31Z,Trump hate extends to anyone who opposes the deteriorating leftest views. Go ahead with a smear campaign for your hero Joe.
2021-08-12T03:40:18Z,"Perhaps Mr. Melber should actually come down to Florida and see for himself. But I am sure even if he did so items would be cherry picked, facts would be distorted, and his politicization of what is going on would be more than acceptable. I wonder how much the DNC pays him monthly to be their water boy?"
2021-08-12T03:39:17Z,2nd grade reading level is all that Trump/Ron supporters understand.
2021-08-12T03:39:05Z,De... Santos is<br>De...stroying<br>De...mocracy for<br>De...lusional donny <br>De...mand his job!!! <br>De...Santos has<br>De...meaned his political position. <br>De... Santos! <br>De...lta Variant IS<br>DE...ADLY!!!<br>Australia
2021-08-12T03:39:05Z,DeSantis: Make America Graves Accumulate!!!<br>Republicans: No no!!! It&#39;s suppose to be great again!!<br>DeSantis: Well my hospitals say differently... But okay...<br>Dems: Sigh... Just be sure it&#39;s your graves and not ours...<br>Me: smh so much for a future from you idiots.... DamErica!!!!
2021-08-12T03:36:57Z,"Reporting the numbers is not hysteria, Ronny."
2021-08-12T03:36:14Z,"This is what happens when we elect politicians so rigid in their conservative ideology that they reject science and common sense. From a PBS documentary on the Spanish Flu in 1918, we’re behaving exactly like some citizens who rejected the advice of wearing a mask and vaccination, and died unnecessarily. In America people have the right to be stupid. As sad as it is, the one bright spot from COVID-19 has occurred: We voted an incompetent president out of office over his response to the virus, amongst other things, and we will vote out any governor that supports any policy that denies science and common sense, and jeopardizes the health and welfare of its citizens. We want forget nor forgive."
2021-08-12T03:36:03Z,California&#39;s governor is dealing with a potential recall. Should only be a matter of time that the same thing happens to Trump toady DeSantis.
2021-08-12T03:35:36Z,Everybody is wrong but me according to Desantis. Florida we will show you America how stupid GOP is. Desanity will show you even if it kills everyone in Florida.
2021-08-12T03:35:04Z,DeSantis is a piece if garbage. He is a danger to humanity. He needs to be removed from office and the Earth
2021-08-12T03:34:38Z,You would think after seeing Trump&#39;s nightmare Handling of  covid he would have learnt ...DUMB AND DUMBER
2021-08-12T03:34:14Z,"Killing people for fun and profit, is a long-standing time-honored Republican tradition in sport"
2021-08-12T03:34:12Z,Desantis does not know governance
2021-08-12T03:33:13Z,"dare  anybody to show scientific data supporting Masks work. THEY DONT!!!!WAKE UP, STOP BEING DUMBED DOWN AND BLUE PILLED BY FEAR MONGERING MSNBC. Middle of summer and covid cases on rise with half population vaccinated???  The virus spreads whether you wear a mask or not. The virus spreads whether you&#39;ve been Vaccinated or not. Ask yourself WHY? WHY is the world being forced,, shamed,, coerced,, pushed against their will to be &quot;vaccinated&quot; with an experimental drug you cannot sue if you take and have adverse reaction to including death?  WHY for a respiratory virus that is only killing less than 1% of those infected? It&#39;s not the Bubonic plague, Typhoid fever, Polio or any other TRULY DEADLY DISEASE!. Do yourself a favor, research counterpoint opinions to get a clearer picture of what&#39;s really going on."
2021-08-12T03:33:01Z,desantis is a piece of  crap......plain and simple
2021-08-12T03:32:48Z,RESIGN NOW DEATH-SANTIS!
2021-08-12T03:32:48Z,"People are dying because of DeSantis&#39; policies. You OK with that, Floridians?"
2021-08-12T15:50:17Z,That is not true. Most of the illegals coming through the open southern border have Covid And are being bussed and flown throughout our country.
2021-08-12T15:50:21Z,"No we&#39;re not. We need common sense and intelligence to go viral, not COVID. 😭"
2021-08-12T16:42:39Z,"People die because they make decisions for themselves. You believe that DeSantis saying you can&#39;t make people wear a mask actually kills people? People wearing a mask if they want to and they get covid is the result of the governor saying you can&#39;t make people wear them? A mask alone does not stop the spread of covid. A shot of the &quot; vaccine &quot; does not stop the spread of covid. The governor saying people can choose to wear a mask or not does not stop the spread of covid. A person who gets a shot and wears a mask can still spread covid. There is no evidence of an exact way to stop the spread of covid. Getting a shot, wearing a mask can help slow the spread says &quot; experts &quot; of a virus that&#39;s less than 2 years old. Covid is here to stay. It will have seasonal surges that are being seen now that are repeating a cycle from last year. Blaming someone for other people&#39;s choices is ridiculous. Since the left can&#39;t blame Trump on a daily basis anymore, anyone who goes against what the left feels is now guilty of killing citizens? All DeSantis is doing is not letting others dictate what people have the choice of doing. He hasn&#39;t said kids can&#39;t wear masks he is saying you can&#39;t make kids wear masks. How is that even remotely wrong? Educate yourself on all there is to know on what you comment on so you actually know what is going on instead of believing what the left has convinced you is happening. People have choices still and blaming another person for a choice someone made that you don&#39;t agree with is such a warped perception and that&#39;s the reason this country has turned in a direction that it may not be able to recover from. People not accepting responsibility for their own actions. Is it your opinion that DeSantis is hurting more Floridians ( like me ) than Biden is hurting Americans with allowing this open border policy that allows illegal migrants to cross into America then be bused or flown around the country at tax payer expense before it&#39;s determined if they are positive for covid? The federal government has said publicly they don&#39;t have enough covid tests to actually test every person entering this country along the southern border. The responsibility of testing then falls on the communities these illegals are brought to. But DeSantis is the issue? The left has really gotten their moral compass twisted."
2021-08-12T17:02:32Z,"J   Then you’d better wear something other than those little paper masks because they don’t do anything. I’ve been vaccinated but we are free to have real questions about these vaccines. Why were doctors with other views, and there were many of them, shut out from voicing their opinions? Other countries with different types of treatments had success such as India which has a much larger population than us. All we ever get to listen to is Fauci, Fauci who has changed his opinion so many times. Right now my state is throwing out vaccines because they are pass their prime."
2021-08-12T03:31:45Z,we are just starting to understand and manage COVID.<br>Now what about Rep virus?<br>VOTE!
2021-08-12T03:31:35Z,WHY IS A WALL NEEDED? WHERE IS BOARDER PATROL?  THEY GAVE POLICE $1000 each of our unemployment bonus .. he bought 174000 votes ..  WHY IS BOARDER PATROL NOT DOING THERE JOB?
2021-08-12T03:31:07Z,I don&#39;t understand why peoples play games with others peoples lifes but they are vaccinate and their children but play with other life ..only I follow my heart and no follow nobody I&#39;m a leader of my life..and no one is going to get that away from me period....
2021-08-12T03:30:45Z,"You guys are hilarious!! When you start to lose you always jump back to Trump as if you think people really have been about a person!!! It’s about  people not losing their individual rights!! No matter who is leading the charge!! You represent a push toward totalitarianism and people see it. You are a bunch of name calling, misinforming fear mongers and people realize it. You just have not begun to realize your propaganda is no longer working. Using children as a political tool is what You are doing!!! You all are SHAMEFUL."
2021-08-12T03:30:18Z,I agree he needs to grow up I think it&#39;s ridiculous that the children in Florida are more intelligent have more common sense and morals and respect for life than there governor who should be protecting all life
2021-08-12T03:30:12Z,"Being a former Floridian, not surprising.   Politizing Public Health and Safety for citizens and our children is ridiculous.   The hypocrisy is insane.  I&#39;m sure he is vaccinated and his children protected with masks at school.   As he spouts erroneous data about Covid and transmission with children, more hospitals are filling up with Covid cases young and old.  He has the gaul to request help from the Federal Government, who he disputes on a daily basis only for the sake of politics but not for all people of Florida.   Disgusting!!"
2021-08-12T03:30:11Z,Don’t<br>Ever<br>Accept <br>The <br>Hypocrisy
2021-08-12T03:29:30Z,Death-Santis Education is on paper only not in his empty incomplete head!  The boarder wall has nothing to do with covid!  Texas needs a power grid not a wall!
2021-08-12T18:36:36Z,True
2021-08-12T03:29:21Z,This man just needs to change his name to Decrapis period I can&#39;t wait the only reason he&#39;s doing it is to have the narrative in 2024 that Dummy Joe couldn&#39;t rid covid but he and your President Mr Dump can .... Lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 just wait for it I&#39;m calling it now years in advance cause the dumb republicans are transparent there ways are fear and won&#39;t work and I can&#39;t wait to see them fail again and again cause we republicans don&#39;t have any good young leaders with balls to change the failing ways
2021-08-12T03:29:05Z,"It’s no wonder the US is way down on the quality of life world index, with people like this in charge !"
2021-08-12T07:41:02Z,"No maga hat understood what you had just said..too many unknown words like quality world and index..you should add comfeve , bigly and many people say and remove the unknown so you can have a chance!!!"
2021-08-12T07:57:03Z,"Hard to imagine the Republican motive. Incidentally, black Americans are twice as likely to die from COVID-19. Something to think about."
2021-08-12T08:19:02Z,Actually a lot of his supporters live in places where the quality of life is much more like a survivabilty score.  The concept of quality isn&#39;t a thing - it&#39;s a resentment for those who do experience it.
2021-08-12T08:20:32Z,And 25/167 on The Economist democracy index. Not much to brag about.
2021-08-12T09:34:05Z,FAKE NEWS!!!!!<br><br> # WARNING: Heavy sarcasm #
2021-08-12T03:29:03Z,What do you expect from a Gov who has the GriftingConMan#45 residing there?   deSantis sounds like the very uneducated that America does not need ~ how did he get elected 🤔?   <b>Vote Him Out</b>
2021-08-12T03:29:00Z,Desantis needs to STEP DOWN has NO IDEA
2021-08-12T03:28:43Z,I wish I could understand the Republican policy it sure isn&#39;t common sense
2021-08-12T03:28:38Z,"Dr Death DeSantis killing off one republican at time, soon there wont be none left"
2021-08-12T03:28:34Z,Withhold the ventilators and imported doctors and hurricane funding from Florida and watch DeSantis come crawling back begging for federal help.
2021-08-12T03:28:29Z,Everyone wearing mask in Florida even in the schools except for Nazi towns Like Punta Gorda or Naples LMAO
2021-08-12T03:27:58Z,"A year ago, most of you dreaded getting a jab, and that u have, you are blaming the spread of the virus on those who haven&#39;t been jabbed...did you blame your govt for not forewarning you of an imminent danger?...no u didn&#39;t...if u have the vaccination, why are u afraid?...you have nothing to FEAR but FEAR itself...roosevelt saif that and loom at u...the media is to blame...Trump was right, fake news..."
2021-08-12T03:27:36Z,When De Santis loses one of his family members; only then will he agree to masks.
2021-08-12T03:27:28Z,You know it&#39;s not so much that this guy is a member of the Republican party but the fact that the Republican party represents cruelty and Injustice for All as opposed to what they originally stood for
2021-08-12T03:27:18Z,DeSantis has learned nothing from the last wave. What land is he living on?
2021-08-12T03:27:18Z,"Yeah, Ron DeSantis is indeed a mini-Trump. And if Carpentersville, Illinois is the &quot;wife-beater capital of the world&quot;, then West Palm Beach, Florida is the Trump-enabling capital of the world."
2021-08-12T03:26:48Z,We do not need any help from foreigners in spreading COVID.  Americans have plenty of home-grown spreading via vaccine deniers:<br>- no vaccine<br>- no masks mandate allowed<br>- super-spreader events (like Sturgis)
2021-08-12T03:25:51Z,"At least the biggest states TX, FL have balls to stand up to the PharmaMafia. 👏👏"
2021-08-12T03:25:43Z,Why can’t they arrest this loon.
2021-08-12T03:25:31Z,Stop using the word &quot; misinformation &quot; . The word is LIES .
2021-08-12T11:22:56Z,Lies are that masks work and that the surge is only in Florida. The entire planet and every state is having a surge!
2021-08-12T11:27:24Z,"Kevin Turner I&#39;ve heard that anti-vaccine and anti-mask is part of a deep state plot to rid the world of the uneducated, the scientifically illiterate, and conspiracy loonies."
2021-08-12T11:49:39Z,@@MrBreeze66 But Florida&#39;s surge is the worst in US and its vaccination rate...one of the lowest. Perhaps do some research before posting ridiculous comments.
2021-08-12T11:50:11Z,@@sophierobinson2738 In that case...goodbye Republican fan base.
2021-08-12T11:53:13Z,@@mikevale3620 don’t take the bait
2021-08-12T03:25:16Z,I think the unvaccinated patients should be cared for by unvaccinated health care workers so that they get the care they deserve.  I think that will work out well for everyone.
2021-08-12T03:25:02Z,How about don&#39;t desantis my life

2021-08-12T03:23:50Z,To think Florida had a chance to vote him out and BLEW IT
2021-08-12T16:03:32Z,"He only won the 2018 Gubernatorial election by some 33,000 votes - and to think, more than that have died since then.  What if the majority of those who died were Republicans, and the majority who survived were Democrats - the next election will be iffy for him at best."
2021-08-12T03:23:31Z,Who is a real American Hero. American conservative love you so much.
2021-08-12T03:23:10Z,DeSantis positioning himself to absorb a shrinking demographic. Not a smart move from any angle.
2021-08-12T03:23:05Z,"Check out the unemployment office nearest you, loser"
2021-08-12T03:21:27Z,"LMAO!!! As of yesterday Florida and Texas tied for 25th place in Covid deaths. Try again, asshats."

2021-08-12T03:19:11Z,A year ago you thought Cuomo was a god now he’s just a multi millionaire book writing quitter.
2021-08-12T03:18:35Z,Calling him mini Trump is dangerous because it will draw stupid people to him.

2021-08-12T03:16:42Z,"Even if Biden had an open border and lots of illegals are just coming in through Texas masks and vaccines have been proven to be highly effective; nothing is 100%.  Wouldn&#39;t a leader promote such proven measures instead of fighting against them?  Sorry DeathSantis, your argument sucks!"
2021-08-12T03:16:40Z,He don&#39;t give a fuxk about anyone but himself

2021-08-12T03:10:59Z,Remember when Florida put Travel ban for Louisiana Residents they thought that would keep them from having COVID cases. Now they worst in America.
2021-08-12T03:10:30Z,It would go a long way if you added a date stamp to your clips.  Randomly putting up clips does not have the impact you could have if you pointed out the time the statements were made.

2021-08-12T07:09:29Z,"They should have guilt. If they cared about their child, they&#39;d be researching and looking for facts instead of letting insane propaganda decide how to care for their child."
2021-08-12T08:17:51Z,"We are in a time where a childs life has less value than support for a politcal party.  If that does not show the devotion of ignorance in this nation goes to the very bottom, I am not sure what does."
2021-08-12T09:39:51Z,"Kinda like Cuomo and the 15,000 nursing home deaths -- except not nearly as bad -- being as how you liberal talking heads have conveniently changed the dialogue from COVID deaths to COVID cases. Kinda like how &quot;global warming&quot; magically became &quot;climate change&quot;. If I ever need any goal posts moved I&#39;ll be sure to give you a call."
2021-08-12T11:17:13Z,"As sad as it is, I truly believe they have no guilt."

2021-08-12T03:06:46Z,and soon the dead bodies will be piled high.
2021-08-12T03:06:38Z,"One state had wrong information posted by the cdc , which is yet to be updated. However the reality is we the people of FL are FREE! <br>If the &quot;vid&quot; was a concern the border would be on lock down and people are flocking to FL because we are free. FL has a VERY high vax rate, and VERY low death rate, LOOK IT UP! The facts show this but MSM says otherwise. Yet DeSantis is the bad guy that needs to grow up. MSM is a psyops.

2021-08-12T03:00:31Z,Discrimination over medical status is illegal!!!!!!! That’s federal law people I learned that in high school!!!!!! But with Oregon getting rid of math and reading as a standard I can see how a lot of you didn’t catch on to that. Regardless of what your beliefs are there are laws that are being violated which is taking away our freedom’s. Even if it is in your opinion for the good of the country it is still against the law a few of the probably 70 or 80 at the Biden administration is actively in breach of on a daily basis🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️.        🤡👠👡

2021-08-12T02:56:21Z,Perhaps he needs to be invited on a tour of an Alligator Farm.  Gators need love too!  I&#39;m sure they would enjoy him wading in their pond at this time of year.

2021-08-12T02:42:19Z,"Why is DeSantis blaming Biden for his incompetence? Because he is not .an enough or adult enough to admit that HE screwed up.

They have NEVER shown you ANY evidence of Trump being guilty of violating ANY law yet he is the only one they ever seem to care about!!  Blame Trump!! Blame Trump!!  Based on the FACT that an estimated 86% of all the stories they post on this site are HATE-Trump posts, MSNBC and Liberals HATE Trump so much they literally pray (to whatever god they believe in) for him to be locked away in prison, for his whole family to be either imprisoned or destroyed and for all his businesses to be bankrupted, which would thus put about 220,000 people out of work, destroying the financial livelihoods of all those families as well!! <br><br>FACTS: You HATE a person who has NEVER done ANYTHING to you or your family or to anyone that you know of.  You call him “H!tler”, equating him to the most reprehensible person to ever exist, responsible for the murder of MILLIONS of people and WWII.  You blame him for US COVID deaths yet do not blame any other world leader for COVID deaths in their country. You call him a “tax cheat” yet NO ONE has ever found any evidence of such.  You call him “traitor” yet NO collusion was the result of nearly $40 Million taxpayer dollars and two years of investigation by as many Trump-hating attorneys as Mueller wanted!  You call him “racist” yet MANY prominent black people consider him friend and he has received multiple awards from minority groups.  Now they have you believing that Trump somehow “led” ”orchestrated” ”incited” ”provoked” the MOSTLY PEACEFUL 1/6 protests.  You continue to show your ignorance!

2021-08-12T02:27:35Z,DeSantis does not respect life. His constituents are dying in droves and he refuses to mandate mask and vaccinations. Factual findings are mask help prevent infection with Covid and the vaccinations even not preventing infection are giving mild case. So Florida is going to have many citizens with compromised cognitive thinking. If you re-elect DeSantis you are welcoming his policies that are deadly. It is the people in Florida who must protect the children from this virus. We don’t need a population of health compromised people with cognitive and long haul symptoms.

2021-08-12T02:26:22Z,impeach the crazies
2021-08-12T02:26:09Z,Is Florida being honest in reporting their Covid cases and deaths?
2021-08-12T02:25:38Z,Can’t wait to vote DeathSantis out.
2021-08-12T02:25:32Z,And you can bet FOR CERTAIN that he is vaccinated 5x&#39;s over!
2021-08-12T07:07:58Z,His kids aren&#39;t.
2021-08-12T02:24:30Z,One speech DeSatan made included comments from… Wait for it… Eisenhower???
2021-08-12T02:24:16Z,"Just stop stormtrumper...stop the make believe because your killing people in your state....Make believe is for tea parties and little girls, get real man, pull you big girl panties up and stop tryin to make your demigod happy and just DO THE RIGHT THING for once...We preach safety first on our highways, in our work places in public but not for the kids, even if the mask only helped 10 percent, ITS YOUR KIDS folks, think about it, stop the fight and think about what makes sence.  Every one of these govs. that are spreading lies should be able to be held on involuntary manslaghter charges....at the least public endangerment."
2021-08-12T02:24:04Z,"Do you think DeSantis has horns under that hair? If not, why is he in favor of Florida&#39;s children massacre by Delta?"
2021-08-12T02:24:03Z,"DeSatan is incredibly incompetent, self-serving and immature, Imo.  Bible scriptures tell us that, &quot;to whom much is given, much is required...&quot;.   He has been entrusted with the power to be a leader, but he&#39;s Mis-leading for his own selfish reasons and that&#39;s Sinful."
2021-08-12T02:24:00Z,They keep whining about holding the source responsible but they refuse to take it seriously 🤦
2021-08-12T02:23:49Z,Wow<br>So many missed informed people in one place<br><br>He just happens to be Florida&#39;s greatest governor in a very long time.<br><br>Start thinking for yourself instead of being sheep

2021-08-12T02:23:09Z,"Stop covering DeSantis!!!<br>That&#39;s the only way he stays relevant, by creating controversy and pushing COVID misinformation everywhere he goes."
2021-08-12T02:23:01Z,"Desantis is not stupid: he is deliberately using the citizens of Florida to breed a vaccine resistant variant of COVID-19. He will blame the variant on Biden, and use it as proof that vaccines and masks don&#39;t work."
2021-08-12T02:22:50Z,Here is the T-shirt for TEXAS -  Instead of &quot;Cowboy Up&quot;<br>Put your big boy or girl pants on and FAUCI UP TEXAS<br>Desantis + Abbott = DeStabb everyone to death in FL and TX
2021-08-12T02:22:48Z,"That DeSantiwhatsisname must be a Campaign Mangers dream candidate: He&#39;s got the looks, he&#39;s got the voice, he&#39;s got the politician&#39;s gestures down pat. The one thing he doesn&#39;t have is a medical degree. He&#39;s just giving the right soundbites at the right time."
2021-08-12T02:22:46Z,Remember when Ronnie said &quot;You wouldn&#39;t want to Monkey things up...&quot; Well we now say next time when he runs for something &quot;You wouldn&#39;t want to DeSantis things up&quot;
2021-08-12T02:22:44Z,Would Desantis be willing to tour some of the hospitals in his state?
2021-08-12T10:05:53Z,"Unmasked,  of course."
2021-08-12T02:22:29Z,Mandates are for authoritarian Democrats who have been vaccinated and don&#39;t really trust the vaccine! Who injects possible harmful drugs without trusting in it?? Fools
2021-08-12T02:21:30Z,"I can’t stand Republican politics right now, but there has only been one child died in Florida from Covid, so this overblown reaction is wrong also. I still think vaccines are warranted, but that helps hospitals, finances and jobs etc, but overblowing it just gives some jerks more excuses to reek havoc."
2021-08-12T02:21:17Z,"Hey America, you elected jerks like DeSantis and Abbott.  You can do much better.  Don&#39;t you think it is time for much better?"
2021-08-12T02:20:58Z,Desantis is a fascist
2021-08-12T02:20:50Z,If u where to hit deathsantis in the head with a spoon every time someone caught covid he&#39;d be dead by now .
2021-08-12T02:20:38Z,Any lawyers here? As Ron is responsible for deaths would it be justifiable homicide?
2021-08-12T02:20:24Z,Fun Fact: Florida and Texas lead the US in COVID-19 surge.  Florida with an average daily death rate of 72.4 and Texas with an average daily death rate of 49.6.
2021-08-12T02:20:20Z,"He&#39;s not actually doing his job he&#39;s just saying he is ... When, in fact, he&#39;s doing nothing. Why do Republicans always think the answer is to do nothing?"
2021-08-12T05:57:42Z,A thing called freedom
2021-08-12T10:50:57Z,"@@christom8605 Anarchy is not freedom. The government is supposed to do three things according to our founding fathers:<br>Provide for the common defense. <br>Promote the general welfare. <br>Ensure domestic tranquility. <br><br>Taking fact and science based steps to protect the public from a pandemic, natural disasters, or other threats to the lives of Americans fulfills these directives laid down by the founding fathers. It doesn’t violate those directives."

2021-08-12T02:19:51Z,Ron DeSantis is criminally negligent.
2021-08-12T02:19:30Z,He&#39;s such a creep. You never travel banned us. DESANTIS LET PEOPLE IN HERE SICK. How else do you think we got it? Not from the poor immigrants trying to find sanctuary
2021-08-12T02:19:28Z,Desatan will b a 1 term f/ up.
2021-08-12T02:19:21Z,"I love that Biden is sending Florida much needed equipment/supplies while DeSantis fiddles while Florida burns and fisses Biden. UR right, DeSantis is at best incompetent, at worst exploiting his dying constituents for his own gain. What a sick man."
2021-08-12T02:19:12Z,To travel to another country you need to show that your vaccines are current.
2021-08-12T02:19:05Z,The worst thing is DeSantis knows he&#39;s spreading lies that are directly responsible for COVID deaths. He just doesn&#39;t care because his base is lapping up his lies and sending him money.
2021-08-12T02:19:01Z,DeathSantis is profiting and playing politics with people&#39;s lives.  It&#39;s disgusting.   Why is being remarkably stupid such a desired trait in the republican party?
2021-08-12T02:18:39Z,Desantis = Stupidity + Liar
2021-08-12T02:18:35Z,Instead of making shirts. DeSantis should do his job!
2021-08-12T02:18:26Z,He embarrassing him self  and his family and definitely his kids. If he married of course
2021-08-12T02:18:13Z,"DeSantis , you forgot  that families  in Florida  also have a right  to protect  their children  from  your  crazy covid  decisions.  They want their  children  to live, not be  sacrificed  for  your  political  ambitions! HOW  DARE YOU!!!"
2021-08-12T02:17:51Z,"DeSantis has zero chance of ever being POTUS. Meanwhile, he is devastating his constituency in an attempt to be the next POTUS or Trumpolini&#39;s VPOTUS!"
2021-08-12T05:09:47Z,"You&#39;re right on!  Trump republicans like DeSantis are killing off their base so hopefully, there won&#39;t be anyone left to vote for them!  Idiots!"
2021-08-12T05:32:39Z,A significant number of Americans voted for Donnie 45. Ronnie DeSatan becoming President would not be that surprising.
2021-08-12T05:45:08Z,Trump had zero chance of ever being POTUS... until he won.  Never again should we underestimate the likelihood of ignorant morons voting in one of their own.  The only way to end a death cult is to let the cultists die.  And so shall it be.
2021-08-12T07:56:07Z,"Just think..if the GOP keeps it up, they won&#39;t have enough voters to win an election for the next 2 generations"

2021-08-12T02:16:54Z,"By the way, I&#39;m pretty sure this makes him personally liable for at least manslaughter &amp; well as child endangerment. Notify the personal injury lawyers! This level of stupidity is beyond comprehension."
2021-08-12T11:59:25Z,"Honestly I’m more concerned about kids not having (properly) socialized for a year and a half with their classmates than I am about them contracting a benign flu. I’m concerned about their liberal parents sheltering them at home all day, for months and months on end, with no end in sight, which I sadly know many cases of."

2021-08-12T22:08:04Z,"I am aware of the horrendous figures, it’s impossible to take them because it’s a state matter anyway.  <br>BUT BUT the urgent point needs to be made that the children are being subjected to neglect and abuse."

2021-08-12T02:15:40Z,"It&#39;s time. Time to say that Trump is a traitor every time his name is mentioned. Time to prepend  &quot;Fascist&quot; consistently in front of every name of a person who chose power and crushed democracy. Fascist traitor Donald J. Trump. Fascist Republican Mitch McConnell. Fascist Republican Lindsey Graham. Oh yes, in a few cases, we can omit the Fascist moniker for the few who have had courage."

Time you people got this straight: Even WITHOUT decent concern for human life (whether or not of your political persuasion) being brought into the mix, it AINT JUST THE REPUBLICANS THIS IS GOING TO BE KILLING! That&#39;s not how viruses work; they&#39;re not selective in that fashion. And the new variants which are showing up are deadlier than ever. So for every Republican who doesn&#39;t get their head on straight and follow protocols, they can have an impact on every single person they come into contact with. Even those who don&#39;t die, may suffer permanent damage from it. Not to mention that, the more people we have in the COVID wards, and the more ICU beds we have taken up with COVID cases, the less medical facilities we have to treat anydamnthing else, from a baby&#39;s birth to heart attacks, appendicitis, gunshot wounds, car accidents, muggings,   or anything else requiring emergency medical attention. Get it through your heads that the attitude it only hurts THEM is as moronic as theirs concerning the virus, the vaccine, and masks....."

2021-08-12T02:55:34Z,White Republicans are the largest demographic of unvaccinated.  .Current death rates for unvaccinated covid victims is 99%. Democrats outnumber Republicans in vaccinations by 40%.  Conservatives are so uninformed and a lot of them will be dead by the next election.

2021-08-12T03:31:46Z,@D. J. Sarcasm stupid. Desantis and the anti vaccers aren&#39;t worried about anyone getting Covid so I assume they wouldn&#39;t worry about their kids getting it eh?
2021-08-12T03:33:41Z,Or how about this. Put all the the Rep kids and anti vacer kids in the same school but do not include any kid with Covid. BUT if any kids develop Covid they all have to stay there? How about that dufus? I wonder how fast the hypocrites would be pulling their kids out of there.
2021-08-12T02:07:40Z,"Yes, grow up DeSantis! Don’t be a trumpist copy cat!"

2021-08-12T02:06:22Z,"Last FL numbers I saw 2 days ago were over 28,000 new cases in one day. I also saw multiple days of over 20,000 before that. So that&#39;s his media hysteria. Just more right wing propaganda for their own political gain."

2021-08-12T02:03:02Z,"DeSantis is obsessed about ideology, but the media is obsessed about vaccination.  Does this man know that it takes at least 5 weeks to fully vaccinate a person?  How is it going to help with the devastating situation facing the hospitals right now?"
2021-08-12T02:02:38Z,The freedom to be stupid is American as apple pie and motherhood.  DeSantis is following Trumputa&#39;s adoration and exploration of the poorly educated.
2021-08-12T02:02:19Z,Desantis is so stupid he&#39;s insane.  Should be legal accountability for leaders who are promoting disinformation that kills citizens.
2021-08-12T02:02:15Z,Wear a mask 😷 and get a shot from the doctor? The horror! I want freedom! Freedom to die

Just a thought, since these stupid soulless things are trying to make a Virus Political.  If you are with them you can give your Funds to the Satanic churches."

2021-08-12T01:58:04Z,At what point does DeSantis&#39; criminal negligence become felony level?
2021-08-12T09:31:01Z,These scum get a free ride to murder kids and their families
2021-08-12T10:02:22Z,Soon
2021-08-12T11:38:48Z,He&#39;s almost a criminally negligent homicide at this point but you see you have to come up with a different charge because he&#39;s some kind of public figure I don&#39;t know if you could really use different ones like you have against cults<br><br>And establishing the Republican party as a cult could be dangerous
2021-08-12T11:54:54Z,"Human suffering and death is only criminal when not state-sanctioned, so the only way to make him pay is to vote him and his GOP lackeys out. Which you can&#39;t, because election tampering is legal if done by the state itself, so they keep voting themselves into power. If the current breed of Republicans ever get full control of the government again, the US is doomed. There is never going to be a fair election ever again."

Turning Florida into a &quot;Super-Spread State&quot; is the only thing that imbecile is doing. Would you vote for this &quot;leader&quot; to protect you and your family?!??"

2021-08-12T01:55:37Z,"Desantos, like Trump, is promoting his campaign financiers more than he is protecting the health, safety and sustainability of his people. There is a word for this--Treason!"
2021-08-12T01:55:35Z,Health care providers and hospital workers should go on strike. There’s no point in taking care of people who have purposely gone unvaccinated in a state that does not support prevention.
2021-08-12T01:55:35Z,"Why hasn&#39;t DeSantis been arrested for put citizens in mortal danger, causing death. @FBI @DOJ"
2021-08-12T01:55:29Z,Just call him Governor ‘Body-bag’ or maybe Governor ‘Toe-tag’.  He like the dad who won’t stop to ask direction. Then drives the station wagon full of kids right off the cliff convinced he know the way.
2021-08-12T01:55:27Z,The right to get you sick..the right to scare you by carrying my AR in public...descant is  a paid for tool of the far right dressed in GOP
2021-08-12T01:55:26Z,He&#39;d do well to ditch the beer coozie and sell crack pipes with &quot;fauci my florida&quot; written on them. I have a feeling they&#39;d be a big hit in the MAGA crowd.

2021-08-12T01:54:25Z,He&#39;s the best governor in the country by far and if you don&#39;t watch yourself he might just end up president
2021-08-12T01:54:21Z,DeSantis is an insane governor.  Must be put out of office at all cost.  If Florida was a country they would be ban to enter the US.  Close Florida Borders to keep people going into state and keep Floridians in.  The Governor has no power to mandate anything.  My business everyone must be fully vaccinated or go find another job. Put all the unvaccinated people on an island with no hospitals and see what happens.  They will be fighting tooth and nails to get a vaccine.
2021-08-12T01:54:06Z,Even second graders have better sense then these republican leaders.
2021-08-12T01:54:00Z,Too bad the government can&#39;t round up all the anti-vaccers and dump em all in Florida&#39; preferably on DeSantis&#39; front lawn. We wouldn&#39;t have to worry about Trump ever winning again. They&#39;d all be dead. Wishful thinking but...
2021-08-12T01:53:51Z,Sooooo can we talk about Obamas Birthday Party

2021-08-12T01:52:46Z,"So how will Ron DeathSentence spin this story to make it about freedom?  <br>Did he read the Constitution as protecting “Death, Restrictions, and the Pursuit of DeSantisness”?"

2021-08-12T01:51:24Z,Money is always King. Someone needs to tell non-mask parents they&#39;ll probably be sued by the nonvaccinated pro-mask parents if their children get sick.
2021-08-12T03:17:21Z,"What do you say to the ant-vaxxers when they lose a child to this disease? Do they admit they were wrong for losing the most precious person in they’re lives, or will they carry on the lie like Desantis?<br>If you want your family to live, move out of Florida immediately."

2021-08-12T01:47:02Z,Considering my sister caught covid twice in 6 months and two of my &quot;vaccinated&quot; clients are in the hospital with covid. That tells me vaccines don&#39;t work and there is no herd immunity for this virus. So you lefties can scream vaccinations all you want. Because what I&#39;ve seen with my own two eyes tell me the vaccines don&#39;t matter. <br><br>I believe what I see before anything on the media.

2021-08-12T01:45:28Z,I find it ironic… you romanticized coumo praised him to the point he thought he was a god.. and yet his covid numbers were some of the worst.. he killed 10’s of thousands.. sexually harassed countless staffers… and yet you want to attack a governor that has the best numbers per population than most other states… <br>You people are flipping nuts…
2021-08-12T01:45:27Z,"I wanna move to Florida I love having that little thing they called FREEDOM, whilst most of the US is living like they&#39;re under the Taliban regime. I&#39;m not a Republican, nothing to do with politics, I just love being FREE."
2021-08-12T01:45:17Z,With DeSantis this was always about keeping the Service and Tourist Industry open. His ill timed &quot;Don&#39;t Fauci My Florida&quot; campaign was to resist schools closure and locking down the State in face of the possibility of a viral surge.<br><br>His gamble didn&#39;t pay off.<br><br>Now no one wants to visit Florida.
2021-08-12T01:45:15Z,DeSantis is sending his constituents to the their deaths.  How many will be stupid enough to follow him? Unfortunately way to many people are perfect candidates for the Darwin Awards. They are willing to take their loved ones into the bowels of MiniTrump stupidity which means serious illness and needless death.

2021-08-12T01:44:51Z,"DeSantis maybe a horrible leader, but we still don&#39;t know if the people of Florida regret electing him the governor. If he gets another term or another GOP politician replaces him we should understand that either the pandemic situation in Florida was overblown or people of Florida love to die because death is just a way to the eternal happiness in heaven. They are strong believers."

2021-08-12T01:44:00Z,"I believe nothing other than catching covid-19 or vaccines will stop this virus. It&#39;s important to understand unlike smallpox which is the only virus we&#39;ve ever eradicated. Coronaviruses not only affect humans but they affect animals, unless Dr fauci can figure out a way to vaccinate every animal on Earth, we are stuck with this virus. Natural immunity seems to be strong and vaccine immunity seems to keep you from getting sick when you catch covid-19. As sad as it is that is the truth and we need to start living with it, and quit hiding from a virus."

2021-08-12T01:43:52Z,I think he should be called &#39; the DeSantis 19 variant&#39;.
2021-08-12T01:43:51Z,Maybe Biden is singling you out in Florida because you are the epicenter of the virus statistically. If you were a country you would lead the world.
2021-08-12T01:43:44Z,Ron &quot;DeathSentence&quot; is certainly doing a good imitation  of Trump. I am curious how the dumbest of the dumb gets to be Florida state governor. He must have some very dark secrets from where his support comes from!

2021-08-12T06:00:55Z,"But, what difference does it really make?  The person with a co-morbidity would almost certainly still be alive today, if they hadn&#39;t gotten covid. Maybe they did have diabetes for example, but they weren&#39;t gonna die from it anytime soon."
2021-08-12T10:39:25Z,"Look it up. Very simple. Covid cases in Florida.  The state has a site, CDC does, John Hopkins does and the New York Times keeps track."
2021-08-12T01:43:08Z,The only lockdown in florida De Satan will allow is the lockdown on the top of the caskets.

2021-08-12T01:40:56Z,DeSantis is a mass murderer - of children. And the federal government of the USA is sufficiently content with that to take ABSOLUTELY NO ACTION. The UN needs to impose sanctions against the USA for these crimes against humanity.
2021-08-12T01:40:53Z,"And then, after letting countless die for his corrupt and sleazy political agendas, the fed gov comes in saves people and, like Chump, Deathsantis will take credit for &quot;saving florida&quot;.

2021-08-12T01:38:44Z,"Why is it that the only thing the government talks about is vaccination? And if you’re going to mention children - stats please not just pictures to strike our heart chords. How about mentioning exercise and eating healthy? And enough about cases - we don’t care about cases or hospitalizations. And it’s funny how just recently the cdc admitted that the PCR test cannot distinguish between strains of Covid, other coronaviruses, flu etc. but we’re still using it to pump up these case numbers. And you want to mandate a vaccine that hasn’t been approved outside of emergency use, has no long term human studies, isn’t a typical vaccine in regards to dead virus and the companies that make them aren’t held liable when they don’t work or injure people. Get behind your own work and then maybe the people can begin to trust you."

2021-08-12T12:08:02Z,The surge at the southern border has nothing to do with the Delta variant being in Florida.  The variant came from India via airplanes to Florida.  DeSantis&#39; ignorant followers are quick to believe his lies because they long for it to be true.  DeSantis is being very Trumpian.

2021-08-12T01:29:55Z,"Did anyone think that DeSantis is being paid by another country? Listening to him, Its sounds like it. If his not, what would be the difference?"
2021-08-12T01:29:50Z,"Child killer, Racist, Senior Citizen Republicans."
2021-08-12T01:29:49Z,"Parents should be able to choose a safe school for their children.  The parents who choose a barefaced, unvaccinated Death Camp for their  children should have school in a separate building from the safe school."
2021-08-12T01:29:45Z,"De Santis&#39;s malevolence is balanced by the self-destructive effect of his measures: so there is a homeostatic effect, much like how Donald Trump&#39;s criminal schemes are often foiled by his own and his acolytes&#39; incompetence."
2021-08-12T01:29:42Z,"&quot;DeSantis , Abbott&quot; the southern border is not the issue innocent children dieing in Florida and Texas is the issue , trump must be very proud of his two pets......"

2021-08-12T01:29:38Z,DeSantis wants his cult to drink the cool-aid
2021-08-12T01:29:28Z,"For the greatest, richest, strongest country in the World, these leaders are absolutely insane. If you don&#39;t lockdown you will never get rid of Covid 19 and it will mutate over months or years. Australia has lockdown and masks are mandatory. We have to sign in to every shop we go in so we can be traced if an outbreak happens. There are rules and regulations for getting out and about. Heavy fines if you break any rules regarding Covid 19. I think most of these rules are good to have in place. Other wise you are dicing with death."
2021-08-12T01:29:25Z,Take the killer down!
2021-08-12T01:29:23Z,Look at mini trump

2021-08-12T02:52:59Z,“Death by DeSantis”
2021-08-12T01:28:52Z,Mandate if you have not been vaccinated due to ignorance then you are barred from hospitals and schools..that governor needs to be impeached and jailed
2021-08-12T01:28:50Z,Doesn&#39;t reflect well on Harvard ...Defund Desantis
2021-08-12T01:28:49Z,"He can&#39;t even stay in Florida and protect his constituents, has to go to Nevada to raise more money."
2021-08-12T01:28:48Z,"Hey Ron, the &quot;experts&quot; you disparage have years of deep training and experience in fields you know nothing about. When and what accredited institutions awarded you &quot;Bona Fides&quot; in either medicine or science or, for that matter, clear reasoning?<br>  You, Ron, are a soiled stuffed shirt, willing to instigate rampant illness and death among Floridians. Look at the daily stats Ron, do they make you proud of your governance? Through your increasingly unreasonable actions it must be assumed your brain is incrementally rotting in your skull."
2021-08-12T01:28:38Z,He is degrading his Republicans and his reputation as the bad leader.  That is not going to support his decisions to run for president in 2024. I ❤️ his action but not my favor.
2021-08-12T01:28:37Z,Gov Con DeSatanis strategy is Fake it till you make it. Not Good enough Governor you are fired!! Fired!!!
2021-08-12T01:28:18Z,What a pitiful person he is!  Good luck FL
2021-08-12T01:28:16Z,"This governor is a cry baby. Get over it, get the proper health measures, n stop grumbling."
2021-08-12T01:28:14Z,"I just hope those people who voted for DeSantis are able to live through this ordeal.., so they can look themselves in the mirror and ask themselves.., &quot;Did I vote for that fool?&quot;"
2021-08-12T01:28:14Z,DeSantis should be behind bars for his criminal negligence.
2021-08-12T01:28:10Z,2nd grade reading level? That&#39;s probably a little more than the average Faux News and AON viewer. Aim lower.
2021-08-12T01:28:03Z,And in other ways I will end up going to jail they can bet on it
2021-08-12T01:27:53Z,FLORIDUH
2021-08-12T01:27:39Z,Yes that is mini Trump. Soon he be asking us to inject desinfevtant in our veins. De santis get it real ok. This pandemic is very bad and is killing our people. You need to care about our floridians. You need yo do u job properly if not they meed someone else to do it and someone that really care about our safety and best interest.
2021-08-12T01:27:19Z,I wonder how many of trump&#39;s pro-lifers are anti-vaxers
2021-08-12T01:27:12Z,"All of these words will come back to haunt everyone believing this. When did any of these people become qualified on any of this. You people are believing in the golden calf. You think these people care about your life? No. Pull at the heartstrings, place blame in false directions, and manipulate numbers to make your story sound good. This left playbook is redundant, mindless, manipulating the simple masses. The governor has nothing to do with covid. He makes policies based on the established laws of the land, not the crying of scared people. Three only thing he mandated is that businesses and private institutions could not enforce civil right killing policies. You people are giving false hope and security to ineffective masks, and vaccines based on Man- bear- pig thinking, and &quot;science&quot;. No man knows how this virus actually works. But, the powers in control have figured out how to weaponize it to regions of our country. You think the governor standing for individual freedom and choice is the wrong one here? Idiocracy rules."
2021-08-12T01:27:02Z,"In reality, he is not aware that this is blowing up in his face!  He wasn’t even aware that equipment was being sent to his State!"
2021-08-12T04:56:42Z,Reality is a mystery to the DeSantis and his followers.
2021-08-12T16:58:31Z,"Either he was lying (which is most likely the case), or the right hand doesn&#39;t know what the left hand is doing!"
2021-08-12T17:55:47Z,Hopefully the actual people who withhold salaries from teachers and school superintendents will have more conscience and intestinal fortitude to refuse Desantis&#39; wishes.
2021-08-12T17:58:18Z,What he is aware of and reality don&#39;t have to match.
2021-08-12T20:53:03Z,Maybe DeSantis was picked on as a kid
2021-08-12T01:27:00Z,Just a clown stupid is what stupid do it&#39;s better to be thought of as stupid then to open your 👄 and remove all doubt 😆
2021-08-12T01:26:57Z,"The reason Florida is being &quot;singled out over covid&quot;  is due in large part to Florida accounting for 20% of the country&#39;s entire case load.<br>How many Americans need to die until the citizenry dumps these sociopathic, GOP frauds?"
2021-08-12T01:26:51Z,If my child dies I will sue these m.f. out of all their money they think  they have to have
2021-08-12T01:26:47Z,Don’t DeSantis my grandparents.
2021-08-12T01:26:33Z,On immigration He should keep his mouth I’m sure at some point his  parents or some one in his family were immigrants
2021-08-12T01:44:23Z,Gabbey Smith agreed
2021-08-12T01:26:32Z,Ron “DeathSentence”
2021-08-12T01:26:19Z,Compassion  fatigue.
2021-08-12T01:26:14Z,Dude California has a Southern Border Fish Don’t Carry Viruses
2021-08-12T01:26:06Z,Ron DeSantis are for freedom to dies even if you don’t want to by him misleading you. But he’s not for freedom to lived by him making laws trying to tells you that you have no rights to wear a mask or asked anyone if they are vaccinated. If I choose to go on a Cruise but I wouldn’t go if everybody’s in there are not vaccinated. What Ron DeSantis is doing is trying to make laws that only benefit one type of peoples. Those peoples who’s against being vaccinated or masks. But he’s wouldn’t have a problem telling women across this country what they should or shouldn’t do with their body.
2021-08-12T01:26:05Z,"Goodbye DeSantis, the ridiculous era of trumpism is coming to an end."
2021-08-12T01:26:02Z,he&#39;s bad attitude killing people in Florida!
2021-08-12T01:25:56Z,Stfu!! Everyone loves Ron here in Florida !!&#39; It thriving!!! And I don&#39;t know a soul down here with COVID!!! F@in liars!!!!

2021-08-12T01:25:20Z,"Trump lost by 7 million votes. He is a loser. Wouldn&#39;t it be better to copy the guy that won by 7 million votes, than the guy that lost by 7 million votes?"

2021-08-12T02:37:11Z,Mayor of Chicago would be a good candidate
2021-08-12T07:01:44Z,And it is genocide🙁
2021-08-12T01:25:16Z,Well I&#39;m guessing that the trump followers are going to be few thousand less by the time the next local elections come around . Unfortunately they seem determined to take the next generation with them which is a crying shame .
2021-08-12T01:24:49Z,One hospital official has come out and said that he wasn’t invited to the governor town hall meeting on the pandemic. You want to know why because that hospital is at capacity with no room. My belief is that he only invited officials from hospitals that have room like private facilities so he could say that the media is lying there isn’t a problem down here!!
2021-08-12T05:47:31Z,which hospital?
2021-08-12T08:17:37Z,"which offical, what hospital"
2021-08-12T01:24:45Z,"Living here in Florida with wife who runs our local ICU...  it&#39;s been rough.  <br>   Unfortunately, the willfully ignorant and misinformed of the GQP here in Florida love him and we&#39;re definitely a red state."

2021-08-12T01:24:33Z,DeSantis is a fascist and a sociopath.  He needs to be removed.
2021-08-12T01:24:25Z,Public health or emergencies aren’t for political fodder…we have Trump and his supporters to thank for this lack of morality
2021-08-12T01:24:24Z,"Yes, he is a mini trumpster!"
2021-08-12T01:24:05Z,DeSantis is trying to get a bigger death count than Trump.
2021-08-12T01:24:03Z,Blame GOP voters. Without them so called “leaders” like DeSantis wouldn’t be killing them without concern.
2021-08-12T01:45:27Z,They would all gladly drink from the punch
2021-08-12T01:46:39Z,Maybe you should get rid of political parties

2021-09-05T16:10:08Z,Ignorant voted Biden.  Just saying
2021-08-12T01:23:19Z,DeSantis promotes child abuse. Apparently you can do whatever to your children and its ok?  Whats next selling kids and other abuse? Not 10 years ago this behavior got you child abuse charges and jail time.
2021-08-12T01:23:16Z,"This guy is insane.. I say if you don&#39;t even care if my child would die because you&#39;re stupid about a simple mash.. Do you have children,, do they wear a mask? Like lying Ted?¿??"
2021-08-12T01:23:00Z,Republican governor Ron Deathsantis is a murderer. You have to have nothing for a soul to be that cruel. It’s hard enough seeing adults with ventilators let alone children. He is willingly killing his constituents and profiting off of it. That should be a crime.
2021-08-12T01:22:54Z,"Finally, finally someone in the media stated that De Santis is STUPID!!!! Thank you, Ari.<br>The problem is, De Santis’ followers, along with Trump’s are as STUPID as they are! They don’t even care if the Delta Virus has already infected the unvaccinated children! And what’s with Biden and our current Whitehouse Administration!? Why are they so weak!?"
2021-08-12T01:22:44Z,"A stupid, egomaniacal buffoon. Literally killing his own people, and the idiots surrounding him are applauding. Makes my blood boil."

2021-08-12T01:22:30Z,An overgroomed waste of time Governor. He needs to go sit down or spend more time at his hairdressers and leave medical decisions to doctors.
2021-08-12T02:45:01Z,"Yeah, unfortunately, I live here. Douchesantis is a real POS.<br><br>What are a few more lives when it will get him thousands of votes from the eternally stupid."

2021-08-12T01:22:10Z,"desantis is playing to the fevered crowd, the last few that are willing to support, believe and cheer for the lies being told.  Tell them what they want to hear and let them die.  By the time they figure it out he&#39;ll be reelected."
2021-08-12T01:22:02Z,Texas is just like Florida
2021-08-12T01:22:02Z,Desander should just step down.  Poor excuse for a politician. 👎

2021-08-12T01:21:41Z,"DeSantis needs to be recalled before the Florida, aka DeSantis variant comes out."
2021-08-12T01:21:30Z,"DeSantis doesn&#39;t care about people. That includes children.  If I&#39;ve doesn&#39;t  care about school shootings what makes anyone think he would care about covid in children. Instead of sending ventilators, send him thoughts and prayers. He only cares about power at all cost."
2021-08-12T01:21:21Z,796 and Governor&#39;s like Abbot they don&#39;t care about our babies under 12 that can&#39;t be vaccinated they have banned mask mandates these children are not protected not even doing virtual learning for them we have to fight these uduits
2021-08-12T01:21:06Z,"He will be known as a child killer, wow what a legacy."
2021-08-12T01:21:06Z,People like this are not leaders and should be removed immediately as a danger to society.

2021-08-12T01:18:45Z,"DeSantis is not a mini-Trump, because he is not a narcissist. He is trying his best to use the tactics of true narcissists - lying, gaslighting, blame-shifting, etc... but can&#39;t quite pull it off, because he is only a regular scheming partisan politician. The rest of the Republican wannabes have the same problem. Trump has had a lifetime of honing his narcissistic skills, these guys are just pretenders, and it&#39;s obvious. To make these tactics work, you have to truly, truly not care about anyone else but yourself; strangely enough that is part of Trump&#39;s appeal to his base. The irony for these Republican politicians is that I think Trump regards their pandering with distain - you would never catch him sucking up to anyone like that - he would consider it beneath him."
