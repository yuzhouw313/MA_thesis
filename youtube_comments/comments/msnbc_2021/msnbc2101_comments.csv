2021-11-24T20:33:28Z,Of course it will reach a million. Hasn‚Äôt anyone been watching the count? The original estimate with no vaccine was 2.2 million. We‚Äôre not completely vaccinated so we‚Äôll just keep counting I guess.

2021-04-02T19:19:23Z,I can‚Äôt imagine what covid would look like with Trump was still president with new variants. I would believe the us would reach 10k deaths per day. I hope no country ever reaches that
2021-02-15T20:37:41Z,<b>why vaccines don&#39;t work</b> ... because... the premise is wrong...  once a disease is manifest... you need to get at the root cause... not a bandage fix... the other facts... they are at most 50% effective... because... your body is given a dead piece of the virus... it really isn&#39;t a good representation of what the immune system needs to look for...  secondly... the adjuvants used to incite the immune system are heavy metals... toxic to the body in any amounts... moral of the story... healthcare is not insurance... do not listen to conventional wisdom... because... it is lacking...
2021-01-28T10:57:34Z,"The question to ask yourselves while watching News during a Pandemic is:  &#39;Cui Bono?&#39; Who is profiting from the governments inaction?  If Big Pharma is a big contributor to Presidential and Senate races, if big banks profit from insurance rolls that are cleared of the elderly, morbidly obese, and the sick?  You don&#39;t need to wonder who incentivised the Trump/Kushner hobbling of the CDC.  There are moneyed interests behind this."

2021-01-12T14:18:09Z,"FYI - letter from Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky the new director of the CDC:<br><br>Last Wednesday, the same day our nation‚Äôs Capitol was in the grips of an insurrection, the United States recorded 3,964 deaths from Covid-19, a record high. That day, Covid-19 claimed a life every 22 seconds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts that this month the country will surpass more than 400,000 deaths from Covid.<br><br>The challenge ahead is enormous.<br><br>On Jan. 20, I will begin leading the C.D.C., which was founded in 1946 to meet precisely the kinds of challenges posed by this pandemic. I agreed to serve as C.D.C. director because I believe in the agency‚Äôs mission and commitment to knowledge, statistics and guidance. I will do so by leading with facts, science and integrity ‚Äî and being accountable for them, as the C.D.C. has done since its founding 75 years ago.<br><br>I acknowledge that our team of scientists will have to work very hard to restore public trust in the C.D.C., at home and abroad, because it has been undermined over the last year. In that time, numerous reports stated that White House officials interfered with official guidance issued by the C.D.C.<br><br>As chief of the infectious diseases division at Massachusetts General Hospital, I and many others found these reports to be extremely disturbing. The C.D.C.‚Äôs science ‚Äî the gold standard for the nation‚Äôs public health ‚Äî has been tarnished. Hospitals, doctors, state health officials and others rely on the guidance of the C.D.C., not just for Covid-19 policies around quarantine, isolation, testing and vaccination, but also for staying healthy while traveling, strategies to prevent obesity, information on food safety and more.<br><br>As C.D.C. director, it will be my responsibility to make sure that the public trusts the agency‚Äôs guidance and that its staff feels supported. On my first day, I will ask Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director, with 32 years of experience at the C.D.C., to begin a comprehensive review to ensure that all existing guidance related to Covid-19 is evidence-based and free of politics.<br><br>Restoring the public‚Äôs trust in the C.D.C. is crucial. Hospitals and health care providers are beyond tired, beyond stretched. I know because I have stood among them, on the front lines of the Covid-19 response in Massachusetts. We also face the need for the largest public health operation in a century, vaccinating the population ‚Äî twice ‚Äî to protect ourselves and each other from a surging pandemic. Because the impact of Covid-19 does not fall equally on everyone, we must redouble our efforts to reach every corner of the U.S. population.<br><br>The research and guidance provided by the civil servants at the C.D.C. should continue regardless of what political party is in power. Novel scientific breakthroughs do not follow four-year terms. As I start my new duties, I will tell the president, Congress and the public what we know when we know it, and I will do so even when the news is bleak, or when the information may not be what those in the administration want to hear.  <br><br>Never before has the C.D.C.‚Äôs partnership with Congress been so important. Last year demonstrated how a frail, poorly tended public health infrastructure can bring a great country to its knees. Public health has been diminished and underfunded for years. The relief package that Congress passed in December is a good start, but more funds will surely be needed to increase the pace of the vaccine rollout; to strengthen data reporting, management and analytics; and to conduct proper surveillance not just of this virus but also of future pathogenic threats.<br><br>Our successful recovery from this virus requires us to make sure that those who have suffered disproportionately are no longer left behind. As the C.D.C. director, I will work to address inequities that have left African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans hospitalized and dying at disproportionately higher rates from Covid-19, by focusing on the health conditions that are prevalent in communities of color.<br><br>Our nation faces untold collateral damage from this pandemic. Life expectancy rates among middle-age adults had already decreased in recent years. Data will likely show that in the past year we have lost more hard-earned ground on immunizing children, helping people control their blood pressure and reducing rates of preventable chronic conditions. Rates of substance-use, opioid overdoses, depression and suicide have soared. We are in the middle of a behavioral health crisis that demands intervention.<br><br>I promise to work with my colleagues at the C.D.C. to harness the power of American science and confront these challenges."

When one of his claims was rebuked by a scientist, Trump responded, &quot;I don&#39;t think science knows.&quot;<br><br>- Echoed the demands of domestic terrorists who planned to kidnap and hold a mock trial for the Governor of Michigan because of her COVID restrictions.<br><br>- Re-routed CDC data through the White House, where it was censored and re-worded.<br><br>- Removed the WHO&#39;s pandemic team from China months before it hit the US.<br><br>- Shamelessly politicized the disease, calling it a Democrat hoax. <br><br>- Repeatedly flouted local safety restrictions, the advice of the CDC, and his own COVID task force.<br><br>- Consistently blamed China for failing to contain COVID, but failed to contain it in the US, and failed to keep his family and White House staff from contracting it.<br><br>- Filled the COVID task force with people with more expertise in PR than medicine.<br><br>- Tried to take millions of Americans&#39; health care away during the worst pandemic in over a hundred years. <br><br>- Made multiple false claims about how it would just go away by certain dates, and was wrong every time. <br><br>- Held many large rallies and celebrations with little to no social distancing instead of setting a good example. He removed social distance stickers from seats at at least one rally.<br><br> - Repeatedly suggested that we should slow down testing so the numbers would decrease and make him look better. <br><br>- Spread false propaganda about COVID being no worse than the flu after telling Bob Woodward that it was a vicious disease, and that &quot;If you&#39;re the wrong person, you don&#39;t stand a chance.&quot; <br><br>- Claimed that 99% of cases were &quot;totally harmless&quot;. <br><br>- Discouraged his supporters from listening to the medical experts.<br><br>- Repeatedly discouraged mask-wearing and ridiculed those who wore them.<br><br>- Constantly lied about the US fatality rate.<br><br>- Repeatedly lied about testing rates and how the US compared to other countries.<br><br>- Baselessly blamed Mexico for COVID spikes in the US.<br><br>- Threatened to defund public education to try and force children to go back to school before the full impact of the disease was known. <br><br>- Baselessly accused hospital staff in New York of selling Personal Protective Equipment &quot;out the back door&quot;.<br><br>- Handled the pandemic so poorly that it crippled the economy and put 9 million people out of work, into a housing crisis, creating massive food insecurity. <br><br>- Claimed that COVID-19 was being overblown because of the US general election despite it being a world pandemic. <br><br>- Lied about Google engineers building a website to help Americans determine whether they need testing for COVID-19 and to direct them to their nearest testing site. <br><br>- Claimed to have saved 2.2 million lives by restricting travel from China, but allowed nearly 40,000 people to enter the US from China. 2.2 million was the projected death toll if we did nothing at all.<br><br>- Claimed this was something nobody thought could happen, when experts both inside and outside of the federal government sounded the alarm many times in the past decade about the potential for a severe global pandemic.<br><br>- Wondered aloud if injecting bleach or somehow shining UV light inside of the body could cure COVID."

The surge we are experiencing now is from the Christmas celebrations including airline travel. Not everyone is masking, distancing and staying home which are the combination of elements to reduce transmission."

2021-01-10T20:43:48Z,"What kind of countries censor voices and writings? Let&#39;s see, China, North Korea, Cuba, Nazi Germany come to mind. Who do they censor, the good guys or the bad guys? They always censor the truth tellers. Why do they censor? Because they are afraid the truth will get out. So now, who is being censored in America right now? Who has been banned on &quot;social&quot; media? Is it Joe Biden? Nancy Pelosi? No? Then surely it must be the militant ANTIFA or perhaps the Iranian leaders? Nope, they all have Twitter accounts. Believe it or not, this country has censored it&#39;s own President and his close allies by banning them from social media and now they are going after the alternate social media companies for allowing them a voice. Extremely telling, I&#39;d say. And if you agree with this censorship then you would have been a great Nazi because Nazis hated any message or idea or person that did not agree with them."
