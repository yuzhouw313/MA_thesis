2021-12-31T09:30:04Z,Great question. I think the answer is yes.. a study was done on a flight that got turned around going to Germany and everyone was either vaccinated or had a negative test. They found people still had COVID or omicron.
2021-12-29T15:29:19Z,"This is not good considering that they don’t have the medical infrastructure to handle a huge wave of sick people.  I know that they are very strict about masking and social distancing, so I hope that they can get this under control."

It&#39;s a small country with a small population compared to the states so of course the numbers will be off when compared to the states. The biggest issues the island faces is the the ease of traveling there and the anti vaxxers and maskers. To many people from the states with bad habits going there!
