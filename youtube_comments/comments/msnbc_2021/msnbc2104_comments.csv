2021-12-17T22:15:09Z,This is such BS! Now the J&amp;J Vaccine on Dec 18th 2021 is not being recommended by the CDC. All the telling the Conspiracy Theorist to SHUT UP!!!. All the Millions of People who took the J&amp;J listening to this Fake News and propaganda by MSNBC and Rachel Maddow. Can&#39;t wait to see the next lie they tell to cover this one.

2021-04-30T05:25:59Z,Yeah thats why tens of thousands of doctors have spoken against it and Dr Michael Yeadon 30 yr scientist and retired VP of Pfizer explains the virus and the vaccine and says there&#39;s no way he&#39;s getting it
2021-04-26T16:53:43Z,We have two good vaccines that are proven safe. Why do we need to risk women&#39;s lives with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?  The health board vote was close. It was not unanimous.
2021-04-26T01:11:00Z,"Maybe people are beginning to realize that the companies which make the vaccines were also convicted of war crimes in experimenting on humans in  the Nazi concentration camps during WWII.<br>The companies who make the vaccines were also fined several BILLION DOLLARS by the federal government for bribing doctors, faking data and killing thousands of people with their drugs."

2021-04-16T10:39:57Z,Could the clot be caused by the way the shot of vaccine was administered?
2021-04-16T05:08:43Z,"The chances of throwing a clot with the vaccine is merely 1/1,000,000,000; while women on birth control face a 1/10,000 risk EVERY MONTH. All 6 of the people who developed blood clots after taking the J&amp;J vaccine were women, age 18-48 (basically, child bearing years). How much do you want to bet they were on birth control? It seems that the vaccine slightly increases the chance that a woman&#39;s birth control will cause clots to form, the next time she takes it after receiving the vaccine. Maybe not even that. they might have developed blood clots, whether or not, they had the vaccine. Fauci&#39;s DEAL is with Moderna. He can&#39;t have another vaccine siphoning off profits, by appealing to people who don&#39;t trust MRNA technology."

But I urge you to stay calm, and don&#39;t get sucked in to the sensationalized media coverage. This is something new and shiny, and media will milk this story for weeks to come. Even though new information will be sparse, until data is collected and analyzed. 2-3 weeks probably. Longer if your country has no centralized patient database.<br>Atm, the numbers says one in a million chance. This estimate will likely become higher, now that the medical community are aware of the possible correlation, and start reporting on previous patients that have had suspect symptoms, after getting this vaccine. But still, there is no need to panic, as long as you have had none of the symptoms mentioned.<br><br>I suggest you have a look at the situation in Europe, as to the AZ vaccine.<br>As far as reporting in Europe has gone, since around December, J&amp;J and AZ, are very similar vaccines, apart from J&amp;J only requiring one dose, and having less restrictive temperature requirements.<br><br><br>A short primer on the AZ situation:<br><br>AZ has been confirmed, to cause the exact same rare complications, of blood cloths and low blood plate count. The European Medical Agency as well as individual countries and NGO&#39;s, have made extensive studies for about a month. But came to the conclusion, that even though the risks are much higher then current estimates for J&amp;J. The risk of getting Covid-19 and having severe, either immediate or down the line complications from the virus. Is greater then the risk of having complications after taking AZ.<br>As far as I&#39;m informed. The only European country that has &quot;permanently&quot; stopped using AZ, is my home country, Denmark. This intention was just made public earlier today, after pausing it for 3 weeks.<br>Though we have stopped using it. That is because of our current situation, of having the pandemic &quot;under control&quot;, as well as nearly having vaccinated everyone, from the &quot;At Risk&quot; groups, and not having a boat load of of AZ in storage.

With AZ, initial reporting also mentioned that ~30-50 year old women were at a higher risk then men. Just like here with J&amp;J. But currently it is thought, that the over representation of women having experienced complications.

But just like the person above, I urge you to stay calm, and don&#39;t get sucked in to the sensationalized media coverage. This is something new and shiny, and media will milk this story for weeks to come. Even though new information will be sparse, until data is collected and analyzed. 2-3 weeks probably.<br>Atm, the numbers says one in a million chance. This estimate will likely become higher, now that the medical community are aware of the possible correlation, and start reporting on previous patients that have had suspect symptoms, after getting this vaccine. But still, there is no need to panic, as long as you have had none of the symptoms mentioned.<br><br>I suggest you have a look at the situation in Europe, as to the AZ vaccine.<br>As far as reporting in Europe has gone, since around December, J&amp;J and AZ, are very similar vaccines, apart from J&amp;J only requiring one dose, and having less restrictive temperature requirements.<br><br><br>A short primer on the AZ situation:<br><br>AZ has been confirmed, to cause the exact same rare complications, of blood cloths and low blood plate count. The European Medical Agency as well as individual countries and NGO&#39;s, have made extensive studies for about a month. But came to the conclusion, that even though the risks are much higher then current estimates for J&amp;J. The risk of getting Covid-19 and having severe, either immediate or down the line complications from the virus. Is greater then the risk of having complications after taking AZ.<br>As far as I&#39;m informed. The only European country that has &quot;permanently&quot; stopped using AZ, is my home country, Denmark. This intention was just made public earlier today, after pausing it for 3 weeks.<br>Though we have stopped using it. That is because of our current situation, of having the pandemic &quot;under control&quot;, as well as nearly having vaccinated everyone, from the &quot;At Risk&quot; groups, and not having a boat load of of AZ in storage. But our health authorities agree, that had the country had a higher number of Covid complications and moralities atm, we would have continued using it. Just like our neighbors. And should our situation change, we might start using it again. <br><br>All of this to say, that at least for AZ. Even when disregarding the obvious societal benefits of getting everyone vaccinated. As far as I can gather. Everyone having studied current data, agree that even for the individual, the risk analysis points in favor, of using the AZ vaccine.<br>And ever since the announcement earlier today, the Danish media and Social media. Have been filled with people who would gladly take the AZ vaccine, if they had the option to jump the queue. <br><br>As a final note. With AZ, initial reporting also mentioned that ~30-50 year old women were at a higher risk then men. Just like here with J&amp;J. But currently it is thought, that the over representation of women having experienced complications. Is because most AZ doses were given to front line workers, of which women are over represented.<br>So the US could see the same correlation, depending on which groups have received J&amp;J so far.<br><br><br>I really hope you read this far, and will take the time to read up on similarities between the two vaccines, and look into AZ in Europe. In a way, we are a month ahead of you on this.<br>Even though it&#39;s two different drugs, at least reporting on complications, so far look almost identical. Hence I believe the AZ studies could give you some piece of mind."

2021-04-14T12:33:04Z,2 Moderna vaccines and I&#39;ve felt totally normal.  I only know 1 person who had the J&amp;J who also had side effects and he had had covid last winter.
2021-04-14T12:28:42Z,Had it 1 month ago... I&#39;m extremely high risk. Metastatic renal clear carcinoma cancer stage 4. Chemo every 4 weeks. I&#39;m still going strong. But the MAGA (Manipulated American Gullible Aholes) will start in for sure... I smell lawsuits

2021-04-14T12:13:09Z,"Zero mention of a previous report on these cases which stated that the number was LESS than the number found in normal population NOT having the vaccine!  Sloppy research and reporting just to get out what sounds much more like a PSA than actual news. FWIW, I‚Äôm a huge Rachel fan, 73 and got my J&amp;J vax probably on the same day that she did and I still have no qualms about my decision to wait for this one versus the first two and all their logistical, weak communication systems for followup shots and bad side-effects issues. I had little significant side effects and I talked to health care personnel at the vax site and they reported the same for all so far with J&amp;J."
2021-04-14T11:58:37Z,"Hey.......maybe taking a experimental vaccine, for a virus with a 98.9% survival rate, wasn&#39;t the smartest idea."
2021-04-14T20:18:43Z,"And the vaccine has a 99.9999% survival rate, and you&#39;re scared of the 1 in a million side effect. Hey, maybe you&#39;re not that smart."
2021-04-14T21:23:51Z,"@@moneypie5102 It&#39;s not about a virus, it&#39;s about control. It&#39;s about ushering in the &quot;Great Reset&quot;, it&#39;s about the DC swamp getting rid of DJT and installing their senile puppet, Joe. People are familiar with the phrase, &quot;history repeats itself&quot;, but few see that history repeating itself right before their eyes. <br>People wonder how Hitler got into power, how could that happen they say, but it&#39;s happening now, not only this country but around the globe. We are slowly losing our basic rights, because the government and mainstream media are pushing FEAR. Fear of a virus, which is a flu virus. Do people wear masks, social distance, stay in their homes, every flu season? We are being played, we are being deceived, we are allowing a tyrannical government to strip us of our Constitutional rights. Next we will have to show papers to go anywhere, travel etc, and it&#39;s already happening. People allow their ego to get in the way of seeing reality for what it is. Call me a conspiracy nut, call me stupid, it doesn&#39;t change anything. I share info because I want to see a better future for us and our loved ones."
2021-04-14T21:41:11Z,@@drugmoney4996 A coronavirus is very different from an influenza virus. The fact that you have regurgitated the falsehood that SARS-CoV-2 is a flu virus really means that the rest of your rant is not credible at all.<br><br>That also has nothing to do with the scientific evidence that the vaccines are safe and effective.

2021-04-14T11:56:46Z,"Blood clots total roughly 600,000 900,000 each year.  Not just last year, but each year.  Roughly 275 people die from blood clots every single day.  It could possibly be said that had these six individuals not had the vaccine, they may have still have suffered a blood clot.  It‚Äôs actually fairly spectacular that out of nearly 7 million people that only six have had clots.  That is extremely low for any population, as clots occur naturally in 1-3 out of every 1000 individuals.  This really is a non-issue."
2021-04-14T11:55:16Z,"Why have birth control pills, which have always caused deadly blood clots, never been paused...or even mentioned."
2021-04-14T14:55:41Z,"@Beach Bum Yeah, meh, it&#39;s only women.  <br><br>Have to admit that back in the day, I was happy to have them, weighed the risk and said &#39;yes&#39;.  Why? Because I couldn&#39;t get my tubes tied until I was thirty, thank you, gentlemen."
2021-04-14T16:29:54Z,"one, we are not sure yet that it is only women, but two birth control pills are not experimental and these shots are. that is why, as to the pill being paused you would need to look back to the 60&#39;s when they came out to see if they were AND remember that it was a different time period, things were handled differently."
2021-04-14T17:00:31Z,"@@DaleHartley Thanks ever so for mansplaining that to us, Dale.  Actually, I was there in the early sixties, and women were considered &#39;unreliable historians&#39; when they reported the side effects. It wasn&#39;t until many years later that the risks began to be openly spoken of."
2021-04-14T17:17:28Z,"@@chezmoi42 np. Im curious why are you sure im a man, and if I was a woman would you have insulted me with the same sexist language? Dale is a non gender name ( Dale evans, Dale arden just to name a few famous female dales)  :) <br>Btw tell me IF my statement was wrong on any account.... Did they pause the product? You were there, you can tell us I did not know.  Were the time different and did they handle stuff differently?<br>Im just curious why you are taking your hate out on me."
2021-04-14T18:05:27Z,"@@DaleHartley  I did look at your profile to be sure.  Yes,  I was being a little snarky, I&#39;ll admit that.  Not hate, sorry, it&#39;s just my first reaction to the subject, which was a bad experience with this from the beginning. Not bad medically - the product worked fine for me - but the condescension from the male medical community from the beginning.  58 years later, the feeling rises up to gag me still.<br><br>In my experience, there was no pause; the demand was too high, and there was no equivalent.  We lived with it, and it became public later.  Ironically, it was probably the pill that forced them to acknowledge that the complaints of the early users were valid; it freed us to become more independent, and to make our personal needs known across the spectrum of our lives."
2021-04-14T11:48:30Z,"First of all, all of that laughing is inappropriate when talking about this matter. Secondly,  if it were her that the blood clot happened to, she wouldn&#39;t be asking that stupid question. She&#39;s complete  ly ignorant as a broadcaster."
2021-04-19T06:54:42Z,"Exactly, there&#39;s nothing funny about this and she claims to be so compassionate what a bunch of crap."
2021-04-14T11:29:08Z,"Why was this vaccine paused for all?  With such a small risk and a limited number of people (women between the ages of 18? and 48) likely affected, why not continue giving the vaccine to all except this group or to make a note of the risk to those within the group to let them know the risk and how it balances against the risk of complications of Covid?  Let the women in the risk group decide which risk to take?"
2021-04-14T12:23:55Z,"I suspect there is more to this that we haven&#39;t been made aware of. Can&#39;t prove it of course, just a gut feeling."
2021-04-14T12:47:04Z,@@starkeymorgan7481 The European Union paused the Oxford Astrazeneca for the same reason and it had the same base.  After some study they returned to using it.
2021-04-14T20:14:30Z,"They did it out of an abundance of caution, not because any data suggested it. They wanted to collect more information, see if there were any unreported cases of this, and get some time to see whether this is actually a real thing. Yeah, it sucks that you can&#39;t get your vaccine while they&#39;re paused, but things will catch up when they unpause it."
2021-04-14T11:10:34Z,"Something was telling me to wait until something like this happening. Wait to see more, withdrawal of vaccination or two, just wait"
2021-04-15T02:50:54Z,Denmark have stopped using the Astrazenica altogether over safety....!
2021-04-15T06:53:22Z,"Even if this risk is proven out, 6 blood clots (of which 1 was fatal) out of 6,800,000 doses administered is still far smaller than the risks from catching COVID."
2021-04-15T11:19:28Z,@@Matt-fl8uy Yes - but the vast majority of those who do catch COVID are at no risk from it - so why take the risk from an Unapproved Experimental Gene Therapy Treatment with very little safety Data.....?
2021-04-16T21:55:54Z,"@@Matt-fl8uy there&#39;s a 99% survival rate with covid. The number of deaths reported is completely inaccurate. CDC has it printed on their website that of the 500000 plus people that have died only 6% actually died from covid. And yes these vaccines are dangerous, in the problem with the MRNA vaccines is the real big side effects don&#39;t show up for a couple years. Do some research"
2021-04-16T21:57:15Z,Good for you for listening to your intuition. These vaccines are deadly. Contain ingredients such as fetal tissue. The MRNA is extremely dangerous and side effects don&#39;t show up for a couple years. You should look into the MRNA

2021-04-14T12:48:03Z,"Really... Just wait for them to get the virus &amp; see what happens. Especially if they get it bad &amp; refusing the mask. Plus, have them sign a waiver stating if they get the virus they will be solely responsible for any hospital bills. Simple fix."
2021-04-14T15:10:04Z,"The really creepy ones are treating masks and vaccines like the arrival of Lucifer.  (Or was it Bill Gates?) They&#39;re nuts, in any case, and I don&#39;t want them around me."

Yes, but the virus kills hundreds or more of people out of 7 million not just 1 or 2 , so you are still way better of taking a chance on the J&amp;J than the virus."

There was also a nursing home in the US where 17 residents who had the Pfizer shot ALL became seriously ill at the same time.
