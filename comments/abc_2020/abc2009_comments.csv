2023-04-10T07:38:56Z,what threatens childrens mental health is the psychopathically evil &quot;adults&quot; who played along with the Live-Action Role-Playing Pandemic That Was Totally Real
2023-04-08T06:16:06Z,"I don’t know why the children are upset over not hanging out with there friends, they should be thankful because one day their friends will make them do illegal things later in there life."
2022-10-10T20:06:14Z,With or without the pandemic I still don’t have any friends I started virtual learning half way through 7th grade
2021-12-14T22:16:01Z,Because the media and left have taken GOD and religion out of society! Kids have no respect or faith!  Stop the media!
2021-08-18T02:03:46Z,Trapped.
2021-06-18T06:09:57Z,"Crazy how this is being done on purpose, to the world."
2021-06-14T04:07:27Z,"The fact that none of these videos have more than 25K views shows we still think of mental health as taboo, even when it comes to our own children. Therein lies the problem"
2021-05-29T02:06:41Z,"🤝🤝🤝 People all around the world not only face with covid-19 , but also face with its consequences such as : stressors , trauma, PTSD, melancholic depression, suicidal thoughts , hopelessness, jobless , mental health crisis risks , etc. <br>WHO &amp; WPA &amp; WB should play its important role to resolve these issues as soon as possible. <br>Pray for our humanities ! <br>Huge loves from Cambodian people"
2021-05-16T03:56:40Z,This is worse than what anyone thought.
2021-05-16T03:53:20Z,The thing is with my scenario is that she wants to make friends and she is not getting that opportunity. This is totally fucked. They are not going to be passed on to the next grade fairly. My daughter cries because she feels alone with no one to talk to. It&#39;s just me and her.
2021-03-26T10:30:48Z,"When I was a kid, the best thing that could happen to me was to be home playing all day alone with no one bothering me. Who likes school?"
2021-03-25T19:27:56Z,The video is very interesting. I read about it in the book &#39;&#39; Mental health issues in the pandemic&#39;&#39; by Arthur Hill and Oswald Howard at Amazon
2021-03-25T09:28:07Z,this bullshit pisses me off its not real its all government controlled for a bigger agenda
2021-02-12T14:11:38Z,Seeing that some of you can&#39;t even handle a year of social isolation tells me most of you were popular/had friends in highschool and it shows. :P

2021-01-14T14:08:45Z,My son misses his friends hes only 4 with hemolytic anemia so he has to be extra careful his school never sent assignments so we pulled him out but we are working with him but we&#39;ve had so many deaths and change this year and this is the hardest thing me my fiancee ever had to deal with and explaining how to deal with everything hard.
2021-02-23T09:57:03Z,So sorry for you losses. I lost my job and started having panic attacks.  I&#39;m homeschooling my 5 and 7 yr old while working over nights. This year has sucked. My kids are depressed and miss their friends.

2020-12-28T16:46:53Z,Well just deal with it. It’ll get better just take it day by day.
2021-01-12T17:16:28Z,We have been dealing with it for 9 months. It called depression and anxiety. It isnt something you can turn on and off or get over in a day.
2020-12-23T05:11:06Z,I have a 12-year-old son and a senior for my 12-year-old it is bad and just getting worse for him mentally
2021-02-23T09:54:49Z,I have a 7 yr old. Same. She says she cries inside ehen she&#39;s sad. She misses her friends. It breaks my heart
2020-12-21T23:37:41Z,So now there is 4 strains of covid 19 because I remember them say months ago that we had 3 strains now they are saying they found another. <br><br>I&#39;m starting to think how much is this is really real and if they are using scare tactics to get people to get the vaccine. <br><br>I for one will not get the vaccine but instead continue to wear my mask and limit who I&#39;m around and keep a healthy lifestyle.
2020-12-12T18:59:21Z,"Stop complying with the orders. Stop allowing you and your kids to be programmed to allow media spread panic to dictate fear. Covid has a 98-99% recovery rate. Far better than most flu strains. And unlike other flu strains, covid has two body counts. Dying direct of covid and dying of anything else but tested for covid post mortem. The panic is artificial, the hospitals and politicians don’t mind because the larger death count, the more federal funding they receive, and if you’re invested in pharmaceutical and medical lobbies.... well."
2020-12-11T18:26:50Z,"There is a virus taking over the world, and I’m not talking about Covid. I’m talking about the virus of sin. But there is a Vaccine for it! His name is Jesus. Not only that, but He took the piercings for you, to release the healing power which is in His blood. It’s the cure to depression, anxiety, fear, anger, etc.. Salvation and healing are available for all who receive Him. <br><br>Turn to Jesus and put your trust in Him. Believe in the Gospel: Christ died for your sins, was buried, and rose on the third day so that you would be delivered from the fires of hell and have eternal life in Him. Jesus loves you!"
2020-12-01T09:17:40Z,Add hunger to that and you have a situation where now adults are failing them also.
2020-11-04T13:42:26Z,With my experience working in  an emergency department for 10 years most of the time the issue is the parents. This has been an ongoing crisis. Entitlement is another big problem. Children are spoiled and anytime the parents take the cellphone or computer away the kid automatically goes to &quot;im going to kill myself&quot; then they come straight to the emergency department. Its a revolving door i see some kids everyother month. Some think its a game. The ones that truly need help break my heart. Majority treat it as a joke or bragging rights. Its disturbing
2021-01-12T17:18:25Z,Thats aweful!!!!
2021-07-04T13:50:06Z,I am glad you didn&#39;t lump them all together
2020-11-04T13:36:23Z,Things are hitting a literal crisis point. I work in an emergency department that has its own pediatric wing with 12 emergency department beds and every day i work we have between 3 and 9 children in the emergency department for crisis. Its overwhelming the system. They can be in the ER for anywhere from 2 days to 4 weeks until they find placement in a psychiatric facility. Most get placement from the er some are admitted if they took an overdose and destroyed there liver from a tylenol od etc. Two days ago my hospital had a total of 45 patients both adult and pediatric that were crisis patients. Its burning out the staff. Every crisis patient has to have a 1:1 babysitting the patient 24/7. We are have alot of staff resigning because sitting and staring at a person for 12 hours is burning the staff out. Monday they had to use RNs to be a babysitter because they didn&#39;t have enough staff. Its dangerous pulling all the cnas off every unit for  1:1s when normally the cnas spend the most time with the regular patients so when a patient is acting off they will be the first to catch it. Something needs to happen. Rebuild all the mental hospitals and asylums.
2020-09-28T21:15:05Z,Shame our government didn&#39;t do anything to stop the virus.
2020-09-26T05:55:03Z,Some kids don’t even have an adult at home through out the day. Mental health is important.
2020-09-26T00:48:03Z,DO YOU REALLY THINK TRUMPET CARES??
2021-01-12T17:26:59Z,"Mre accuratly, do you really think the government in genral cares?"
2020-09-25T15:28:17Z,It took several months before we started thinking about the mental health impacts of the shoot from the hip policies to deal with Covid??? That was simply lazy thinking.

2020-12-09T19:54:53Z,I do all of that. But I can&#39;t be normal. Why do I hit myself from stress? Emotionally breaking down from losing my friends and crush. I scream and cry when I&#39;m alone. I can&#39;t stay up to date with my assignments without crying. I don&#39;t want to leave this world.. I want the missing pieces of my hear back. Now people think I&#39;m weird online. I used to have friends that cared but now I&#39;m a ghost. I can&#39;t make friends properly anymore. Worst introduction to middle school ever. I wish this was all a dream.

Kids know nothing about how the government works or about money, or education thats why they are children because they are learning. What child has come to you and has said &quot;hey healthcare is bulls**t&quot; they do not know. Kids grow and know how to play, and learn what parents and teachers teach them. These parents in this article are harassing these kids and nonstop teach them about how bad covid is instead maybe teach them that it will be ok, and help them learn and grow and at the same time stay positive and give them reason to be happy.  I have 5 kids who i have to work 50 to 60 hours a week, teach them at home and still make them breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and at the same time i make some time to take them outside and play with them, or watch a movie or play video games. How about you grow up and stop trying to find a reason to why what i said is wrong and try to understand why i&#39;m right."

2020-09-23T03:43:05Z,We have to take mental health very serious if you have that you have everything and if not look for help you need to speak up
2020-09-23T14:25:55Z,I agree
2020-09-23T03:42:02Z,Long face goes after children eventually.
2020-09-23T03:40:35Z,Stop talk about this mess to kids. Let them play in the yard. Camp in back yard. Go walking ride bikes
2020-09-23T15:20:20Z,Agreed !!!!
2020-09-23T17:08:27Z,Unfortunately everyone else is talking about it
2020-09-23T18:30:54Z,@@foodandhomeprep8425 don&#39;t let them hear it. Also I can tell them it&#39;s going to be all right and things happy in life . Things always change. Let&#39;s go out and play put on mask and Wash&#39;s after having fun.
2020-09-23T03:39:14Z,Im not saying it’s easy but the calmer the parents are about this whole pandemic situation the easier I’ll be with the children. Find solutions not the problem. Positive mindset regardless the situation
2021-04-10T00:35:09Z,"Somewhat! Having calm parents doesn&#39;t change the fact that they&#39;ve lost school, lost recreational activities, and other things that they had before this virus. There will still be lots of longterm repercussions from all these restrictions."
2020-09-23T03:36:25Z,Let&#39;s create a bunch of fear and panic.  And then run a story on children&#39;s mental health.  Mainstream media are sick puppies wow you guys.

2021-02-03T02:09:08Z,It’s not a big deal for YOU because you’re old and already lived your life. High school and college aged kids like myself are missing out on the best years of our lives and we will never get these years back.

2020-09-23T03:16:26Z,"COVID-19 SUCKS. And kids know it! It breaks my heart to see our young generation so stressed. <br>At least that mom has the opportunity to go virtual. Our district is F2F and virtual. And cases on campus are rising. Quarantined teachers, students and staff are on the rise. Go figure! 😢<br>I find with my kindergarten and 1st grade grandkids, keeping a normal as possible routine is helpful. Reassuring them things will one day get better helps. Board games, outdoor activities and just talking with them about normal life stuff are good stress relievers."

2020-09-23T03:26:43Z,They live it every day it all around them. Tracy soo don’t talk about it ? Same stupid response as 45 mean while people are still expiring and getting sick. l wish people like u could work a week with me to experience . you wouldn’t feel that way if covid affected your family or experience death or deaths.
2020-09-23T15:57:46Z,"@@queendavis3135 I&#39;m sorry, but your comment isn&#39;t readable. I&#39;ll respond to what I could understand. Talk about it-YES! Non-stop talk about it-NO! Kids need to know they&#39;re strong enough to get through crisis and hard times! Panic attacks while playing with friends?? C&#39;mon! Kids shouldn&#39;t even know that terminology. Have a good day."
2020-09-23T03:00:05Z,We need to come together and pray for change.

2020-09-23T02:53:21Z,"@ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IBU9-9FGeo&amp;t=4m30s"">4:30</a>  This guy describes the anxiety of every kid that can&#39;t attend school, every person who has lost a job, people living with no digital access in rural areas with kids to educate on-line, and over 200,000 people across this nation who are mourning for lost loved ones.  They are ALL sick at heart over current events in one way or another.  Each and every one of them are being ignored to death by the current administration&#39;s complete failure to insist on even the most simple of protections against an aid-borne pandemic - a face-mask.  The United States government did a MUCH better job of identifying and requiring the use of this simple protection from a deadly disease OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO!<br><br>With millions of dollars funneled into politicians&#39; pockets through the 2010 Citizens United decision which enables the ultra-rich to pack their piles of money into off-shored accounts to avoid taxation, the American People don&#39;t seem to have the full attention of our government these days.  If you think this pandemic is bad, don&#39;t EVER think that things can&#39;t get much, much worse.  Ask people &quot;living&quot; in Venezuela.  I will vote for the person who supports the Common Good by supporting the rule of law. No authoritarian dictatorships for me, thank you.  We had all better vote like our very future depends upon it.  Because it does."

2020-09-23T13:39:35Z,"Don&#39;t wear an unwarranted fear promoting mask and don&#39;t allow them to kill you with a ventilator with the supposed neumia like symptoms but this one is with no nucous which is special kind of detox the body goes through.  What is needed are protocols that help detox happen safely and quick. Vit C and D, zinc, silver and different ways to flood you&#39;re body with oxygen without drowning the body in oxygen like a ventilator does.  Just the other day the CDC said they made an &quot;error&quot; in saying the virus can be communicated by air.  This was couple days after they said that a mask was more effect then the next vaccine.  It&#39;s possible the second statement was made truthfully after a lawsuit was started regarding their first statement about the masks preventing contagion."
