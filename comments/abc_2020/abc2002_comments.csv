2020-03-31T02:53:44Z,Why they&#39;re aren&#39;t  wearing  a mask in the streets🤔😱 😡😡???? Even reports??? There are no more  supply.
2020-03-28T04:39:54Z,"As if we are rehearsing the apocalypse! Everybody left their job, their power, their education and they fell into trouble. It reminds us of the horrible day that parents will escape from the parents, parents and siblings from each other in the mahşer square, right? What an invisibly small microbe has feared mankind walking on earth! How helpless we are. If we can look at the events as a lesson, it will be mercy. Our Lord sends us a divine warning in blessed 3 months! Did we understand? Every soul will taste the death! If our fear was not death, but to die with faith, how would it contribute to us? Whenever we take measures to protect against sins, as well as to clean up to protect from the virus, if we fear our Lord as much as we fear the virus and death, If we comply with the bans imposed by our Lord as well as the bans imposed by our state. If we can escape from sins as much as we escape from the virus THEN WE ARE FROM THE REALLY TO THE LIBERATION. While washing our hands, let&#39;s take ablution, and get rid of our sins, our spiritual viruses. Because those who escape from sins have the greatest good news and rewards. Just think, Our state is announced live today! &quot;The virus has been completely destroyed. The danger has passed. Go out to the streets &quot; How would we feast, right? Let&#39;s think about this. Our Lord is saying. &quot;O my servant, he prevailed over the sins of the rewards. I forgive you. Come on. You can enter as you wish through the 8 heaven gates. I made you a neighbor to my Prophets, now you are from heaven &quot; Who knows what joy did we experience? Think about it, our dear Prophet Hz. Muhammed Mustafa s.a.v is there, all the Prophets (as), sahabe-i kiram, awliya, all our loved ones are there💕"

2020-03-20T13:44:15Z,"Are you in need of face mask or alcohol based hand sanitizers to keep you constantly protected? Are you having troubles with the long queues at the stores in getting your required items? Do you want to get tested at the comfort of your home with a scientifically designed Russia test kit and get result in 18 hours? Do you also need the chloroquine and Zinc Treatment Combo to keep your immune system strong and fight off the virus? If yes, then I suggest you contact this professional hacker to save you from the present world crisis. Prevention is better than cure so please stay home and quarantine yourself. I’m so happy that I got help from hacker Gavin. He is a professional online carting and medical hacker and I’m glad that I contacted him for my desired needs and necessary pandemic essentials to keep myself safe without leaving the comfort of my home. He also shipped a scientifically designed Russia test kit to my home and I got tested myself without having to go to any hospital. It is a big risk going to the hospital to get tested as lots of positive patients are out there making it easier to contact the Covid-19 virus at the hospital. All I did was share my home address with hacker Gavin and I had all my orders shipped to my door step conveniently. You can contact this great hacker “Gavin” via Gmail  (cyberhackinggenius) or text and speak to him directly on his phone and WhatsApp : +19256795146 and don’t forget to thank me later!"

2020-03-01T21:19:17Z,"Countries like Italy, Iran and S. Korea (in the beginning) do not respect the problem. Look at the film clip and see how many are wearing masks. In Italy, their culture involves a lot of body contacts (hugging and shaking hands). That is enough to get a hit. These scenario are being talked about in some U-Tube comments weeks ago and they all come true. The Korean church forbid the members to wear mask for a 2 hours service and ended up with an 80% hit rate (Tested 1000 of 2500 and 800 hits). In Iran, did not see a single mask in their government meetings. small observations like this tell you they need to pay more respect to mother nature.... good luck."

2020-02-27T22:10:21Z,They really think we’re all just so gullible huh? Lol Main Take Away: the flu shot has many strands yet the flu shot is given EVERY year but you all knew about the corona but now barely pressing us on it? Why haven’t you been giving shots for it then...I mean we all know the immunization will be here in no time. It’s a money scheme that simultaneously fits in with their depopulation agenda. PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH EVERYONE! Do NOT let them oppress you with their scare tactics. Look into the United States PAST scare tactics on minorities especially.
2020-02-27T19:00:20Z,"Faced with the incompetence and shame of the Italian government, Japan is different. Japan found that the new crown virus was originally the birthplace of the United States.

2020-03-01T02:45:10Z,"Sorry, but that&#39;s a very weak argument. When was the last time a doctor treating the flu showed up in full protective gear? The problem with this virus is the unknown.

2020-02-26T04:21:13Z,"Some valid experiences in China:<br>1, the virus incubation period is very long, there are cases more than 28 days<br>2. The virus is highly contagious, and will attach to clothes and metal wood for 2 to 12 hours, so be careful of your elevators and many people&#39;s touch items. Don&#39;t be too close to others talk, because you don&#39;t know if he has a virus.  Masks u need one.<br>3. Virus aerosols form where patients gather. making infection easier<br>4, the biggest difference from the cold symptoms are: shortness of breath, difficulty breath.<br>5, older people are particularly dangerous. The overwhelming majority of deaths in China are older people over 60 years of age.<br>6, pay attention to your pets, their fur will also adhere to germs.<br>7. Do n’t go to crowded places, don’t party, don’t eat together, don’t hug everyone. When the virus happened, the Chinese were having their biggest holiday, the Spring Festival. This is a family reunion Festival. So, the best thing for virus transmission happened.<br>8, the virus may infect many people, but not everyone is seriously ill. Most people are cured without chemicals.<br>9, Chinese herbal medicine helps most Chinese people<br>10.Only 2% or even lower mortality rates are in China.<br>11, doctors and nurses must be well protected. In order to rescue critically ill patients, more than 2,000 doctors and nurses in China were isolated because they were infected. More than 10 people died. They are heroes.<br>12, We need not listen to Chinese suggestions, we can also watch Chinese jokes. If we have the ability to build 2 hospitals in 10 days,  and  will mobilize more than 10,000 medical doctors and nurses from across the country to reach Wuhan in a week."

2020-02-26T00:31:30Z,"Hi,  I live  in the red zone in Italy,  specifically I am in Codogno.  <br>Since Last Friday we are in quarantine.  Yesterday they did open a couple of supermarkets, during very strict hours we could go. Long line up and long process because they only let a couple people at a time inside.  <br>We have drop off of supplies at the checkpoints.  Milan is a whole different story, they witnessed their next door neighbour (us)  going into quarantine in the blink of an eye.  let’s face it,  large cities have a different feel&amp; Large population , sent them (not all) in total panic. <br>i am in Codogno in quarantine since Friday along with 10 surrounding towns.  We were out of  masks and hand gel from the get go.  <br>I have been sharing my day to day on my Facebook page. If anyone is interested,  I did post about the supermarkets on two different posts,  available in both French and English . <br>So far, 11 have died, 1 was cured.  Most were elderly with fragiled in some case with other health conditions, the younger was 57 but also in poor health.  The number of positive is a useless number as only a few hundreds made the test.  They only test you if you have symptoms... and still, there is few people who are sick with fever for days, soar throat and all and they tell them to stay home .  Ps. Masks are often  sold out and Hands sanitizer. We were ordered to close our restaurant Friday at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRnf-mHBrF8&amp;t=17m00s"">17:00</a>, all businesses had to shut down.  Now only food stores &amp; pharmacy are aloud to open.  What about all of us store owners,  we are left out.  Not everyone can line up for 3/4 hours every other day, we sell food, why are they so disconnected?  there are alternatives to have crowds, delivery/drone.  Many businesses are going to take a big hit. <br>Our life as been completely turned upside down. I don’t wish this on nobody."

Italy is the only country using correct methods of identification of infected, while other countries use only the temperature scanner. This makes the outbreak in Italy look huge, because other countries too have an huge outbreak.<br>3. Italy is not ashamed of admitting failures. While other countries such as China, Iran, USA or Russia would rather try to hide negative opinions.<br>4. Italian scientists from Rome were the first to isolate the coronavirus.<br><br>So is the outbreak a huge problem? Yes.

I doubt contracting it is a death sentence for someone with a healthy immune system unless the world at large is hiding that it&#39;s the bubonic plague. It&#39;s probably just overwhelming the areas that the thousands of people are being infected, surely a lot of people who need medical attention more so than others aren&#39;t able to receive it and that&#39;s likely raised the mortality rate. Them rushing to build a hospital would support the idea that they just simply weren&#39;t prepared. Read an article about how it really isn&#39;t as deadly as the previous Coronaviruses in recent years like SARS and what not, but it just can spread faster and farther and so will infect more people who would easily die from a flu or something of similar severity. That&#39;s what I&#39;m gathering so far. Just giving in to the worst case scenarios that some are painting will do you no good, even if you must acknowledge all possibilities to prepare for them."

Also with people that don&#39;t have many or no symptoms spreading it around to the people with all those conditions (young and old),  This is a good reason to not internationally travel.    If you get it and bring it back home with you, you  risk spreading it all to countless people.  Some won&#39;t be in perfect health."

I pray that people who don’t know you will come to know who you are in these times of distress. You said that you would never leave me nor forsake me. We need you Lord. We need you. <br><br>“He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High Will remain secure and rest in the shadow of the Almighty [whose power no enemy can withstand]. I will say of the LORD, “He is my refuge and my fortress, My God, in whom I trust [with great confidence, and on whom I rely]!” For He will save you from the trap of the fowler, And from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you and completely protect you with His pinions, And under His wings you will find refuge; His faithfulness is a shield and a wall. You will not be afraid of the terror of night, Nor of the arrow that flies by day, Nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness, Nor of the destruction (sudden death) that lays waste at noon. A thousand may fall at your side And ten thousand at your right hand, But danger will not come near you. You will only [be a spectator as you] look on with your eyes And witness the [divine] repayment of the wicked [as you watch safely from the shelter of the Most High]. Because you have made the LORD, [who is] my refuge, Even the Most High, your dwelling place, No evil will befall you, Nor will any plague come near your tent. For He will command His angels in regard to you, To protect and defend and guard you in all your ways [of obedience and service]. They will lift you up in their hands, So that you do not [even] strike your foot against a stone.”<br>‭‭Psalms‬ ‭91:1-12‬ ‭<br><br>Lord we need you now! In your precious name, Jesus, I say Amen."

2020-02-25T15:12:16Z,Cindy I don’t believe in multiple Gods because there is only one true living God. Open up the Holy Bible and read for yourself. I’m reading right now 1&amp;2Kings. The same God I pray to is the same one who created you and me. 😊
2020-02-25T15:34:35Z,"@@gelisalynette7739 You don&#39;t have to believe in them all, there&#39;s plenty that don&#39;t believe in the one you believe in either.  They all have one thing in common, they are not proven and people think they created the world and all that it encompasses.  It&#39;s called faith for a reason.  No one really knows what&#39;s true or right, religion is just a belief.  People believe in sorts of things,  including faith in religions of all kinds with some having the same God and others having a different one, or millions.  Who&#39;s to say yours is the one and only? indoctrination into a religion is used in all of them.  They all have their books/ scriptures ect, but they all can&#39;t be right! and since organized religion is just mass brainwashing,  take your pick of a God or Gods, or choose to not believe at all.  Mind you, every brainwashed person around you, will try and indoctrinate you again."
2020-02-25T16:27:12Z,"Cindy if I don’t believe in those idols then why would I pray to them. I say read the Bible because it literally tells us what’s to come. I haven’t heard anyone from a different religion say that their book says that. The one true God will and has been making himself known to all of us. Everytime you wake up. Everytime you’ve escaped danger. That fact, the living word (Holy Bible) spoke of this. Notice the passage I posted the first time speaks of things like this. But also, letting the believer know that God will protect us from it. In Gods commandments, he tells us not to worship any other God but him. God is a jealous God. He has alright to be. He gave me life and he can take it away if he chooses. He’s kept me safe and I will praise him everyday regardless of what other people may think or feel. I’m not going to bend to please others because I was made to serve and worship the one true God. So I pray that EVERYONE COMES TO THE LORD. he will never leave you nor forsake you. My life hasn’t been the best but God has always been solid to me. So I will not worship anyone else but God. In Jesus precious name I say AMEN"

2020-02-26T07:11:01Z,Up to 14 days before you get sick. But now they believe that it can be up to a month. So try to avoid everyone you can for a month or two.

Suddenly, there will be no more cases in China, but there will be in everywhere else in the world and China will make it&#39;s move as the new powerhouse. Like when colonizers used their diseases to kill off a majority of American Indians, though it wasn&#39;t on purpose they certainly used it to their advantage. However, China is DEFINITELY spreading this on purpose. They were too prepared."

2020-02-24T18:07:08Z,"Back in January when things were starting to go out of control in China, I told myself and other people, that the only way to stop pandemic is to stop all movement from China. I don&#39;t know why the heck this wasn&#39;t done."
2020-02-24T21:23:31Z,"@TheDoubleLibra You are so right. Here in Iceland, they say they dont want to damage the tourist business. Last year about 2 million people came to Iceland. 100 thousand of those were from China/Hong Kong. And thats mostly summer months. closing in on Chinese now would mean nothing except to the hotels and the rich guys who are saying &quot;we want people here&quot;. So you are sooooo totally right. its all about bloody money."
2020-03-10T14:46:35Z,"@TheDoubleLibra thank you friend. You should come here once this situation is over. Im goong to buy some  dry foods, like bars, canned goods and cbeese. Better have it if people will go out of control."

2020-02-24T18:01:26Z,I&#39;m in Italy but for some reason I&#39;m not scared of this virus but d peeps around me are scared and I think it&#39;s starting to affect me
2020-02-24T19:59:54Z,"Well over 200 cases confirmed in days, who knows how many there are who are infected already? and if even one infected person visits a same store as you then youll probably get infected without gloves/mask and washing hands."
2020-02-24T20:20:31Z,Lol
2020-02-24T20:23:44Z,"Let&#39;s do some math. Population of Italy: 60.48 million. Confirmed infected: 219. Deaths: 5. This gives thus far a 8.26 x 10^-6 % chance to die from Corona(A VERY VERY SMALL NUMBER). 219 is not much more than 5 when we are in the scope of millions of people, so the chance of getting it is not far from that number. 5/219 gives a 22% chance of fatality from this ratio, but I&#39;m sure the infected rates will continue to steadily rise while fatality rates increment very slowly. The point being, we have 7.7 billion people on this planet, and these numbers shouldn&#39;t scare anyone if you pay attention. Every potential disease should be treated seriously, but the media has yall going crazy with this one."
2020-02-24T20:42:49Z,"@@hempster0072 well ita new kind of corona virus and also mutatious, so it could possibly mutate now to more infectious and deadly, also spanish flu had 2% death rate yet killed around 60-100 million, this one has been expected to be around 4% so far. 7.6 billion people /100 x 4 and youll get death numbers on average"
2020-02-24T21:18:16Z,"@@jak743 That&#39;s only 2%..... that is not a big ratio in terms of our world population. Who is predicting it&#39;s supposed to get to 4%? Sounds like a lot of assumptions. My point is to treat it seriously, but not to worry. 60 million out of 7 billion is still a very low ratio. And your equation for an average is not correct. By your math (It should be times .004), = two million eight hundred thousand. Still a very small number compared to 7 billion."
2020-02-24T18:01:00Z,GcMaf would sort this out also C60 would be enormously helpfull.

2020-02-26T17:43:39Z,@@Ugh_mommy I don&#39;t know why probably because they only care about the countries that got infected the most
2020-02-27T22:38:27Z,Mr_ SpiderITA715 Until it’s facts honey your guess is as pointless as mines. The fact is if it’s here in the US they need to put it on the map and we need to start taking and talking about preventive precautions like all the other countries. Cmon?

2020-02-24T16:51:48Z,"Don&#39;t mistake WHO&#39;s &quot;Doctor Tedros&quot; as a fumbling, dithering medical egghead humanitarian; this guy is a cold-blooded, self-serving political animal and he could care less how much of the Earth drops dead from the Wuhan virus. …. For decades Tedros was the right-hand hatchet-man of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, leader of Ethiopia&#39;s &#39;Tigrayan People&#39;s Liberation Front,&#39; a brutal military dictatorship rooted in Marxist/Leninist ideology. Many Ethiopians view Tedros as a brutal dictator in his own right. Little wonder then that Tedros is comfortable glad-handing and pandering China&#39;s Xi Jinping. .... To ascend to Director-General of WHO, Tedros hired a professional American lobbying firm to campaign on his behalf that, among other things, spin-twisted Tedros&#39; nearly non-existent public health accomplishments (while appointed by Zenawi as Ethiopia&#39;s Ministry of Health) into holy water that converted Tedros into a global political darling. The truth of the matter is that, back in Ethiopia, Tedros remains accused of orchestrating several cover-ups of large cholera epidemics, so as not to tarnish his own reputation. <br><br>Anything &quot;Doctor Tedros&quot; says or does is about nothing other than increasing his own political capital. <br><br>And, btw, according to a 2017 AP article, WHO spends $200 million annually on travel expenses, no small part of that on five-star hotels, expensive dining and first-class airline tickets for its entitled bureaucrats. That&#39;s more than WHO spends to fight AIDS, malaria, hepatitis and tuberculosis -- combined. <br><br>Given all this it&#39;s quite the wonder that America foots the largest chunk of WHO&#39;s $4 billion annual budget and bows to its constant cries for even more handouts.<br><br>So there you go, now you know &quot;WHO&quot; &quot;Doctor Tedros&quot; and &quot;WHO&quot; really are."

2020-02-24T22:03:16Z,"@Hiroo Advani Because the US is afraid of China. No one will admit it, but the fact is that the West’s #1 priority these days is to please Xi Jinping and keep the bastard happy.

2020-02-24T16:33:52Z,Well to be practical the disease hasn&#39;t killed children under 9 at all and the death likelihood in ppl the age of 20 to 30 is only 0.2%. It grows worse for older ppl. But then again if the child gets it they can pass it to the adult so both should be protected and also we still don&#39;t know everything about this virus.
2020-02-24T20:13:49Z,Oranjmuse Meyer .They say kids don’t get it
2020-02-24T23:07:35Z,Evolution...
2020-02-24T15:57:13Z,"These numbers are still way too low for this to be international headlines. More people are affected and killed by smoking cigarettes each day than this damned variant of the flu, people need to get their priorities straight.."

2020-02-24T15:56:38Z,Every  country  should  stay  away  from  China because  China  keep  virus ever  where.
2020-02-24T15:54:50Z,"Most deaths are the elderly, who’s broken down bodies could potentially be shut down by a common health cold. Seeing my 30 year old friends who are in the condition of their lives panic about this acting like we’re all dead is getting annoying... If you’re healthy enough to go shopping in a mall and not get sick you’re strong enough to beat a virus"

2020-02-24T15:50:26Z,"2% chance of dying if infected with Coronavirus. Was 33% death rate with ebola a few years back. People are so silly and overly paranoid way more these days with internet than before. This will take more of a toll on our global economy moreso than our global health. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23pragmatism"">#pragmatism</a>"
2020-02-24T17:10:24Z,The problem isn&#39;t the death rate. The problem is that it can infects people in an asymptomatic way. This means that you cannot contain the virus (in a normal way). Because of high number of infections you will have more deaths despite a lower deathrate. If it continues killing ~150 people a day it will have a much higher death toll than Ebola.
2020-02-24T17:35:54Z,No. In italy the chance of dying (if you&#39;re not too old and have patologies) are about 0.2%.

2020-02-24T15:23:03Z,Well... that’s what they get for eating the innocent animals. And the majority of Italians are catholic or Christians which proves religions are false because in the 40 day journey in the Bible what part of “God killed the people because of their desire for meat” do they not understand? And then in 1st Corinthians chap 3 vs 1-10 they bring up that event of the 49 day journey what part of “that was written for an example for us in the last days” do people not understand?
2020-02-24T15:32:07Z,No it was Released from a Biological laboratory next to market
2020-02-24T15:43:37Z,The hell are you talking about
2020-02-24T15:47:24Z,Sniper Viper you will NOT understand so that’s too bad. All the ones preaching in any religion to be good and not get involved in violence are hypocrites because they eat animals which means they contribute to animal cruelty. If they were true holy people they would not be contributing to animal cruelty. Sexually violating billions of animals torturing them tormenting then it’s not if God. They are blinded to where it says in the Bible of the 40 day journey that God gave the People a choice Manna or Animal to eat; the ones who chose the mana everything went well for them but the ones who ate the animal it says that God killed them because they went after their desire for flesh. <br><br>Then in the New Testament it recalls that event and says that that was written as an example for us in the last days. So all religions that eat the animals are false because they are blinded to such scripture that says for all that eat the animals they will suffer dire consequences
