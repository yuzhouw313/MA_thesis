But when something like this happens why dont we as people have the hospitals and equipment we actually need? I dont see the money from 50million people being used to build a new hospital and providing jobs and health care in any state. Hope this virus wipes out half the population because some dumb cunts need to die.

Why are those coming in from other affected countries no being quarantine for at least 2wks as it&#39;s been told it could take 14 days to even show any symptoms. Why haven&#39;t we stopped all out of country flights why has the CDC set on their thumbs and done nothing . Why because they could care less.

2020-01-28T15:21:55Z,The way the governments are reacting honestly makes me wonder how our countries haven‚Äôt fallen apart yet. If there is a contagious deadly disease which potentially spreads just by breathing in the same air as someone who is infected SHUT DOWN THE FREAKING AIRPORTS! A couple people stuck in China is a lot better than 5 other countries potentially being infected &amp; by the time the airports are shut it has already spread to the US &amp; Europe. They need to get a grip of the situation NOW!
2020-01-28T15:38:52Z,"A couple people, it‚Äôs more than people, it‚Äôs cargo planes and their staff, aid in and out of China, ect. You can‚Äôt just shut down the worlds second biggest economic power, definitely when they are practically dependent on foreign trade to support 1.4 billion people."
2020-01-28T18:38:05Z,Zach B but isn‚Äôt loosing trade periodically better than potentially loosing half the citizens in your country?
2020-01-28T21:46:07Z,"Phoebz :D no, because losing trade is potentially the same thing. The best thing to do is chins shut down effected airports, and to block traffic between provinces"
2020-01-28T15:21:36Z,Does anyone else notice that most illnesses start in China? It almost sounds like population control like the socialist in the us supports.

Therefore a 1K bed hospital is pointless. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s a hospital at all. Wuhan and the other cities shutdown have at least 15-20 hospitals.

2020-01-27T20:30:52Z,"what if more people are already infected and not knowinf whats going on? surely those 5 people must have contacted other people before they got quaranteened. Think about it. When they were inside airplane, other passengers must have got it. Its a common sense. Be careful everyone."
2020-01-27T20:30:45Z,We absolutely must evacuate people from China......<br>How dare anyone try to contain the virus there........<br>After all we need people here in America walking around with it.
2020-01-27T20:26:21Z,People act like this is really the end of times. This is no different than pneumonia or flu. People get it and people die from it...yeah that happens with every other respiratory illness too. Imagine all the people who have gotten it who haven&#39;t went to the hospital and are at home taking Nyquil. With that many cases and only 80 dead. It&#39;s not killing that many people. 80 out of 3000 is about a 2.5% chance of death and not to mention alot of the ones who have died are older people which is exactly the same thing you see with pneumonia
2020-01-27T21:15:09Z,"80 people died is just what the government tells us to not cause panic. It is already known the goverment always lies and the real death toll count could be 10x or 100x more than what is actually being said. This virus is spreading quickly and over a 100,000 of people could already be infected. It is confirmed it can pass through your the air, mouth, nose, and now your eyes. It&#39;s more dangerous than the flu since we know very little about this virus and have no vaccine for it"
2020-01-27T22:00:34Z,Corona Virus is Billie Eilish music 2% is actually alot considering how fast and strong this virus is spreading. If all 7 billion people caught the virus 2% of that would be 140 million people dead

If you look now, the comment section under the video is turned off. Conspiracy theories do little to help in times like these. The number of infected rose by about hundreds and at most, a thousand people. Don‚Äôt make wild assumptions simply because of the thrill you get by doing so.<br><br>The main reason why medical staff in Wuhan and nearby provinces are reaching out through social media is so that they can get assistance from more health organizations and more medical supplies such as masks, suits, and even more medical staff.

Don‚Äôt make wild assumptions simply because of the thrill you get by doing so.<br><br>The main reason why medical staff in Wuhan and nearby provinces are reaching out through social media is so that they can get assistance from more health organizations and more medical supplies such as masks, suits, and even more medical staff.

My understanding of it is though they are ordering tests from the cdc, then using serums, collecting samples and comparing the respiratory system of the individual to known patterns from infected individuals as there is/was no specific tool for diagnosing this particular virus. They might have come up with something more effective by now but at the very least its a wait and see sort of thing using the patient data from China, probably why it was taking so long to get results back. Small towns with inadequate facilities would probably transport suspected patients, if a sizable population showed symptoms a mobile hospital may have to come to them."

2020-01-27T15:53:41Z,Liberal biased ABC.
2020-01-27T15:52:29Z,Just imagine starting up an mask cover business would surely earn a lot üòÅ.
2020-01-27T23:29:27Z,"Yup but also,lose a lot on the day of reckoning."
2020-01-28T13:33:10Z,@@allanallen1835 oh yeah<br>You Christian?
2020-01-28T15:00:51Z,Stella Bella! I don‚Äôt need a label to have a belief so not answering that.
2020-01-27T15:50:42Z,These stories are just to ensue panic in the States.
2020-01-27T15:50:26Z,"Wake up! It&#39;s a Pandemic, you fools! Geez!üëéüá∫üá∏"
2020-01-27T15:50:17Z,Price gouging on surgical masks is now in vogue.
2020-01-27T20:49:39Z,That&#39;s funny because surgical masks are useless since they A aren&#39;t air tight and 2 they are made to protect the patient from getting infected from anything that&#39;s in the surgeon&#39;s mouth and d they don&#39;t even protect your eyes which the virus is now confirmed to infect through the eyes
2020-01-27T22:06:39Z,Maybe carrying lysol spray or wipes everywhere and They also can steam the air everywhere with hot water like SARS long ago üò∑
2020-01-27T22:54:28Z,Hope the box dosent say made in China
2020-01-27T23:17:14Z,"@obummersux wow, you got a thin layer of cloth the weight of a ping pong ball for 10 bucks? What a great deal, if only more people knew..."
2020-01-27T23:22:51Z,Yeah it‚Äôs fkng disgusting making cash from times like this. I get people have to make a profit but at what cost. If your buying masks don‚Äôt get the paper ones get the m3 respirator ones.
2020-01-27T15:47:13Z,All thanks to Chinese who created the virus!
2020-01-27T15:42:53Z,Welcome to Agenda 21 and 30. Dont believe me do your research
2020-01-27T16:19:45Z,are you saying this is fake
2020-01-27T16:33:01Z,It‚Äôs not fake. It‚Äôs Government induced. And it‚Äôs so in our faces I can‚Äôt believe people are falling for it. The second day this was out they announced the exact spot this originated. That‚Äôs impossible. There are thousands of Wet Markets there and no way they could narrow it down that fast.
2020-01-27T16:33:35Z,"@@amysteele6540 no not at all. I am an ex government officer. The Agenda is out in plane sight. Many many of these outbreaks or new flacka drugs were born from a CIA lab. They call it&#39; &#39;cleaning house&#39;. If you are interested read and make your own mind up. <br>I am retired now and live alone within the English forest. I can no longer deal with <a href=""http://h.bs/"">h.bs</a> . I am devastated that these events have come into play.<br>With love from Elle, sanctuary owner x"
2020-01-27T16:33:46Z,There is a Government patent on this Virus back in 2014. This was made in a lab.
2020-01-27T16:38:52Z,@@twinflameswithtempy7019 that was my point this is not fake at all
2020-01-27T15:38:18Z,Actually don&#39;t worry guys coronavirus is &#39;made in China&#39;  so it will die anyways
2020-01-27T15:37:39Z,CHINA :Greatest producer<br>Coronavirus:Made in china
2020-01-27T16:17:42Z,"I see more Iran found the one mammal &quot;BAT&quot; that could host the virus mostly effecting dogs mutated to now infect people.. Corona has been K9 for 20 years at least. On that note be sure to get your Dog their vaccination..  May ur God or Gods, watch over u all..."

2020-01-28T13:06:34Z,Good one
2020-01-29T03:36:34Z,I‚Äôm curious to know if object can contain the virus. If yes we are doomed because everything is from china.
2020-01-27T15:35:37Z,Stay away from San Francisco ..
2020-01-27T16:03:29Z,Let them stay away from whole fuckin worls
2020-01-27T16:13:41Z,If the homeless people catch the virus they would cause a plague
2020-01-27T17:38:36Z,San Francisco is the anus of Cali

2020-01-27T15:31:06Z,Deport all asians üòÖ
2020-01-27T15:31:00Z,I hope they do the smart thing if they bring the Americans trap in china back to America and quarantine them until it is proven that do not have the virus
2020-01-27T19:55:35Z,"You would still introduce a risk to the general American Public, don‚Äôt you want to keep the virus as far away as you can?"
2020-01-27T15:30:16Z,Thanks china
2020-01-27T15:30:03Z,Prepare your bunkers everyone !!
2020-01-27T16:12:29Z,Justice Boofer Damn i envy you lmao :P

2020-01-27T19:19:22Z,I feel you like something tells me the world has to strat over. Politics and money shouldn&#39;t even exist its all man made that took advantage of people that couldn&#39;t make their own food so work was made to trade in for food
2020-01-27T22:10:04Z,So what‚Äôs you gonna do???
2020-01-27T15:25:36Z,The virus isn&#39;t even that bad it has the same kill percentage as the flu. Most people dying are already sick and elderly and can&#39;t fight the pneumonia brought on.
2020-01-27T15:23:10Z,Now China doesn‚Äôt have time to fight with Trump trade war. They are busy fighting the virus ü¶†.
2020-01-27T15:22:17Z,Just close all airports is that so hard come on
2020-01-27T15:30:12Z,Philip Bellezza it gonna spread regardless they need a cure
2020-01-27T15:32:51Z,Cheap Living ofc we need it but airports can just close at that time so many countries have it now

2020-01-27T15:52:53Z,Cheap Living the goal is to limit the cases which in that case that would work while working on a cure
2020-01-27T15:54:51Z,@@salahsantar8504 - thank you for that link. Videos like that are hard to find! The one I&#39;m looking for is the one where the doctor/nurse in China is saying that they need to wear eye goggles as some have been infected that way.
2020-01-27T15:20:58Z,We‚Äôre fucked

2020-01-27T15:35:53Z,Im sure its been here for longer that what the media portrays. Its just all about timing
2020-01-27T15:39:13Z,Lol? That was a different virus.
2020-01-27T15:50:18Z,"I believe that was a different strain of the coronavirus, i think there are 9"
2020-01-27T15:53:11Z,@@livi3263 you believe?? Oh ok well your beliefs must be fact. Smh
2020-01-27T16:08:05Z,"Can you tell me what you know about the child in TN? I&#39;m new in that state and heard a few times that someone here had the virus, but then the articles I saw got deleated."

Keep your hands away from your face and wash with soap and water, instead.  Or better yet, wear latex gloves and then dispose of them after you wear them.

2020-01-27T15:34:18Z,Well we know its not only 5 goverment is lying to us
2020-01-27T15:17:39Z,What if a China man sneezes on you like the mist mode on Windex

2020-01-27T15:21:01Z,The end is only the beginning.
2020-01-27T15:28:11Z,"Well the 2002 SARS outbreak wasn&#39;t, the 2009 Swineflu outbreak wasn&#39;t, the 2010 Cholera outbreak wasn&#39;t, the 2014 Ebola outbreak wasn&#39;t the end either. So maybe take a sensible cautious approach before spelling doom and gloom. There are statistically way worse things to worry about like slipping in the shower or getting run over."
