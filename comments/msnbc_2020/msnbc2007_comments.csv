2023-05-22T03:37:29Z,"I never showed positive for COVID, but I have the hallmark sign from my chest x-rays of &quot;ground glass opacities&quot;. I ran around with bilateral pneumonia with atelectasis (collapsed lungs) in my lower lobes for 2 months. I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath to cough up the congestion. I went to urgent care twice for antibiotics (Nov 2021 &amp; Jan 2022). I am glad to be able to post this as a survivor. I&#39;m a nurse who used to work ICU/CCU. I&#39;m thoroughly convinced if I had gone to the ER, they would have intubated me and hooked me up to a ventilator. They would have inserted chest tubes between my ribs to reinflate my lungs in the ICU. I would have died. It is by God&#39;s grace I&#39;m still here to tell you my experience."

2020-07-09T00:15:55Z,"You only have your president to thank for the mess that America is in right now. I remember him saying that this week 15 people have died next week it will be 5 people who will die and the week after it will disappear. It‚Äôs a cough he said, nearly 130,000 deaths and over 3 million infected people and he‚Äôs still saying it‚Äôs under control. He said the fire is out whilst it‚Äôs spreading like a wildfire, he has turned America into the biggest embarrassment, liability and laughing stock on the planet right now and some people still can‚Äôt wait to vote him back into the White House.  It‚Äôs insanity what he‚Äôs doing to America and it‚Äôs people nearly every other country has it under control but because trump knew that if he didn‚Äôt open the economy he would loose the president job, so he‚Äôs open the economy way to soon at the expense of the American people because he knew he had nothing else to offer you all. Trump has blinded his supporters with greed and stupidity and because he‚Äôs gave them a comfortable lifestyle they didn‚Äôt see the whole picture his supporters have been living it up and enjoying themselves so much they didn‚Äôt see what their chosen one was really about and that is he‚Äôs a horrible racist lunatic and has become America‚Äôs first dictator unfortunately for the people. If he was in the Middle East America would invade the country and take him out has a threat to world peace"

The risk was initially overestimated because many people with only mild or no symptoms were not taken into account.<br><br>Up to 80% of all test-positive persons remain symptom-free.

2020-07-09T00:59:54Z,"Crom the Wise Everyone who tests COVID positive, even the so-called asymptomatic has lung  damage.  They haven&#39;t yet tested for other damage.  This is a very, very young virus.  We have so much to learn.  A higher testing rate does not put people in the hospital or increase the positivity rate.  Try posting something rational."
2020-07-09T01:00:00Z,"@@Andrew-yb1uv Not any more.  Check the last two days.  Deaths lag infections ALWAYS.  Also, even day before yesterday when our death count was &quot;low,&quot;  it was still the 3rd or 4th highest death count on the planet."
