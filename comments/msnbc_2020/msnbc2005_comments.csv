Now Indians can see the Himalayas for the first time in decades for some it was the first time ever and the night skies are clearer, even in the cities. You can stare into the night skies now and see more stars. The air we are breathing is also cleaner. One thing, that&#39;s all it was that changed and we all got to see the benefits. Imagine what would happen if we got rid of hydrocarbon use all together from this point on. This is an opportunity for governments to see the benefits of renewable&#39;s and create new renewable infrastructure projects."

2020-05-25T23:09:37Z,"I often hear the argument &quot;I don&#39;t want to change my lifestyle&quot;, when people argue against green policies. I think the pandemic is showing that &quot;in the future, just about anything is possible&quot;, and sometimes, the effects are out of our control. If we think that a 4 month or one year lockdown is tough (while we all wait for a vaccine), then you are going to just hate it when half of Florida goes under water. Yes, the ice caps are melting.<br>At the very least, the pandemic has shown to us what can be achieved if everyone pulls together, on a global basis. And in that respect, the fight against the covid-19 virus and climate change are similar in that both needs to be done globally. A greener policy in one country is nullified if some other country can attract businesses with less strict environmental protection policies in place. No one country can &quot;elect&quot; to be absent from any accords.<br>I am not an alarmist. I am a realist. We have not seen the full effects of climate change.
