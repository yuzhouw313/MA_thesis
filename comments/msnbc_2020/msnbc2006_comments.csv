2020-07-19T23:11:55Z,All these socialists want is lock down.  I hope to God there are enough smart people out there to realize if you give these socialists a lock down it will never go away.  There will always be a reason.
2020-07-03T20:45:31Z,I guess you can never have enough tyranny... at least not according to Robert Francis...
2020-06-30T15:29:29Z,Take that political knee off your neck Abbott and think for yourself to do the right thing for your Texans! Make the minimum of mask wearing mandatory Statewide before you have more of a catastrophic epidemic on your hands! LEAD this great State to set an example and stick to it!
2020-06-30T12:51:08Z,Get em Beto!
2020-06-29T14:18:42Z,Yeah just keep everything shut down until the economy is completely destoyed. You might have lost your business or job. You might be homeless and hungry. You might lose eveything and go into debt. You might go without the healthcare you need because only coronavirus matters now apparently. But at least your government decreased the odds of you getting coronavirus. And if you go through all that and get the virus anyway. The politicians will just shrug and give you a insincere apology. None of them is losing their job or need to worry about income. Burn the village to save the villagers.

2020-06-27T00:58:09Z,"LMAO, get a better person to speak on this than BETO! He‚Äôs not liked so much here anymore, not after he started spouting about his gun control ideas. How about an actual person who has a stake in unseating Abbott? <br><br>Also, he is full of it. Yes, all regular ICU beds are full at TMC, and yet, Covid patients only account for 28% of that total. Every leader at TMC has insisted, they have a considerable amount of beds available before capacity is anywhere near  being overwhelmed. That‚Äôs why we shut down, to have time to build up supplies. It was never to shut down until there was no threat. <br><br>So, I feel like Abbott has done a good job, listened to experts, acted accordingly, but Texans need to up their game."
2020-06-27T00:22:34Z,Sounds like Texas is getting what they voted for.
2020-06-27T00:21:36Z,Texans better hope things in the ICUs don&#39;t become like Italy when doctors had to choose which patients got aggressive treatment and which were (essentially) left to die.

Wearing a mask in public should always be a person&#39;s personal choice. I don&#39;t want or need someone to feel they need to take care of me. That&#39;s my responsibility, not someone else&#39;s."

2020-06-26T19:44:40Z,Why people put up with a guy like Abbot who a month ago took a position of total denial and went full steam ahead &#39;we&#39;ll be okay&#39;. Then sits there at a news conference with a &#39;well something has happened&#39; like it was all new to him. Abbot insults voters with a pivot that he doesn&#39;t even admit to. You cannot ignore that minorities bear the brunt ... no skin off his nose.
2020-06-26T20:06:28Z,You think that&#39;s bad? Trump was the same but he&#39;s still yet to acknowledge that cases are rising
2020-06-26T22:30:10Z,I hate Abbott because I believe the first lockdown was authoritarian.  You people scare me.

2020-06-26T20:01:31Z,"Never. Trump himself can&#39;t be arsed with the virus anymore. To him it&#39;s just an annoying distraction. He&#39;s basically declared victory over the pandemic already and is now trying to move on from it. <br><br>Unlike all his other controversies though, this one is not going away!"

2020-06-26T19:41:38Z,How is this not classified as murder?
2020-06-26T19:52:25Z,"Trump is trying to slow down testing even though he knows it will lead to unnecessary deaths, his only reason for doing this is to make himself look better.<br><br>That&#39;s not my opinion, that&#39;s what Trump literally told us all on national television! He is the biggest murderer"

2020-06-26T20:03:07Z,I love how they&#39;re blaming protesters when:<br><br>A) The spikes are almost entirely occurring in Republican states<br>B) The original covid protesters were Republicans! The anti-lockdown protesters in April who Trump was encouraging!

2020-06-26T19:55:11Z,The US is 22nd in the world for tests per capita. But Trump wants to slow testing down to make himself look better!
2020-06-26T20:00:46Z,@@chrismitchell3203 I know.  I&#39;m in Dallas and everything was fine until Abbott intervened.  I&#39;m so disgusted with him and Dan Patrick.

2020-07-03T00:19:50Z,"Governer Abbot is a pos sellout we all know he&#39;s playing politics. Covid-19 is pretty much BIDENS campaign to avoid doing debates and the boy I tell this virus is smart it&#39;s spiking in states where Mr. Trump will be doing his rallies. I was planning to move back to Texas , but he&#39;s alow life Republican sell-out and I changed my mind. Yeah go ahead Abbot play plotics you and go along with the democrats agenda to create a Communist state. Fk you! I will share and spread this information like wild fire you have no idea!"
2020-06-26T19:34:46Z,"Beto, please demand that Governor Abbott and LT. Governor Dan Patrick to resign, plus call for international help (üá∞üá∑, üá≥üáø, üáπüáº, etc.) The US and state leadership is showing that they incapable of dealing with this."
2020-06-26T19:51:18Z,I agree.  I think we should all demand they step down - especially Dan Patrick.  His suggestion that we Texans should be willing to die for the economy isn&#39;t working out so well for him....more Texans are dying and the Texas economy is tanking as well.  Patrick is so monumentally incompetent.

2020-06-26T19:33:43Z,"Beto should have stayed where he was and ran for Cornyn&#39;s Senate seat instead of a wasted, quixotic Presidential campaign. Every time I see Beto O&#39;Rourke, I see a missing seat in the Senate in this upcoming election. That&#39;s about it. Nice to hear from him though, I suppose."
2020-06-26T19:48:16Z,"We have two excellent Democrat candidates running for that seat - my bet is Heger will win the run-off.  Regardless, I doubt Cornyn will be defeated, but, along with Beto, we are registering as many Democrats as we can in Texas.  We&#39;re especially going after the new Texas residents who haven&#39;t transferred their registrations over from their previous state of residence.  Beto isn&#39;t resting - he&#39;s still working for Texas and all Texans."
2020-06-26T20:13:32Z,Beto knows ELECTIONS in the south are  corrupt ! I&#39;ll support him ANYWHERE !
