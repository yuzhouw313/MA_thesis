2020-11-30T11:15:01Z,"I agree there should be daily briefings. Also more news stories need to show the effects of this disease; not only the deaths but the long-term damage it causes those who survive. They also need to show all the people living in tents because nobody is helping them. In addition to that, they need to show cases in which businesses are not taking safety measures and not closing down when employees and customers get sick and businesses that are making people work who are infected. The media needs to shock people out of their denial if we are ever going to get this monster under control."

2020-11-30T04:45:22Z,"I am a realist and I&#39;m sorry, but there is no need to vaccinate perfectly good and healthy people with a vaccine that has not been tested well enough.  It takes years to fully test  medication&#39;s and vaccine&#39;s, so I&#39;m sure there are people that are not going to take it and with very good reason not to. Also, Biden has done nothing to do with this journey of Covid-19 and should not get any kind of credit for any kind of success that comes from anything that the Trump administration has done thus far.....You wouldn&#39;t do a bunch of work at your job and then have someone come in and just pick up where you left off, after all the hard work has been done by you and then they take all the credit,  I know I sure wouldn&#39;t.... that&#39;s my opinion on this vaccine and if you don&#39;t like it, I really don&#39;t care, so no need to comment on my comment."
