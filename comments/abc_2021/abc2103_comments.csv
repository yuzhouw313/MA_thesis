2023-01-11T03:50:51Z,"i had these symptoms when i had covid a few months ago, i was sick as hell too but this was definitely the worst part. they were more sensitive than they&#39;d ever been (and my eyes have always been fairly sensitive, mostly when i&#39;m sick, but with covid they were just teary 24/7 looking at anything hurt, quick eye movements hurt) the pain caused by eye movement was gone after about 2 weeks but ever since my eyes have become more sensitive and it hasn&#39;t stopped. i can&#39;t be in a bright room or looking at an even slighly bright screen for a few minutes without my eyes feeling strained and getting teary and i&#39;m scared it&#39;s permanent. i still have perfect eye sight. they just can&#39;t handle much. though luckily it is MUCH much better now than when i actually had covid, it&#39;s still very annoying and i just hope it will go away but my eyes hurt as i&#39;m writing this ;s and also mine didn&#39;t get bloodshot though, there was no physical tell on my eyes other than that they looked very tired"

2022-10-06T02:03:58Z,I haven&#39;t been able to wear my left eye contact in over a year. any make up makes my eye blood red and my lid swell up . ive had prescription drops and gels and ive seen specialist. i had a lesion on my inner eye lid and conjunctivitis that turned into cellulitis that moved down into my face. no one can explain it and said that it may possibly be due to Covid. im 53 yrs old and never had eye problems in my life until now.
2023-06-11T03:01:37Z,"Yeh shots can cause this certain ones in the past have done the same things to people and one of the main eye problems is conjunctivitis and if you&#39;re already prone to it then it makes it worse which is has done to my mum and her brother. Sadly some people who never had it, it brings it on and will become a permanent conditionüôÅso expect flair ups anywhere from the start of the year to in the spring to summer months because pollen also effects the condition why it flairs up then goes away. <br><br>The way to treat it is hot compress and special antibiotic drops which they won&#39;t prescribe lightly and it will take a while of going back until they decide to when they see it&#39;s not going away during a bad flair up, of course it will always be a bad flair cos of the shots. It&#39;s sad they won&#39;t admit to any problems and these shots didn&#39;t even work giving people health problems for no reason."

2022-07-14T14:06:13Z,"I‚Äôve got Covid with eye pain now. It‚Äôs been 4 days. If you had eye pain, did it go away, and how long did it take?"
2022-12-04T07:21:36Z,"It did finally, thank god.  Worst prolonged pain I&#39;ve had.  Took almost 3 months to go away... But that&#39;s probably because I tried to push through it and continue working on a project that required lots of staring at the computer. <br><br>Obviously we don&#39;t know even a fraction of what is going on, but I think the two keys I can say for me were inflammation and &quot;convergence insufficiency&quot;.   Antiinflammatories treatments helped- cbd, steroid drops, antihistamines too for whatever reason.<br><br>All the basic tips to increase moisture are good too- humidity, wear glasses, avoid air flow at your face, yada yada. <br><br>But I&#39;m now beginning to think the convergence insufficiency was a big part of the problem.  In part because ultimately the only way I got better was to vastly cut back screen time and basically rest my body and eyes lying in the dark for like 2 weeks.  Several days of total bedrest and no screens.  <br><br>But while resting and avoiding screens helps, staying indoors and being a shut in is, ironically, part of the whole problem.  There are papers on how CI doubled during early days of lockdown and the actual rates are probably much higher.   And it&#39;s not just screen time, it&#39;s more just being in confined spaces where your visual focus is always extremely near. <br><br>So while you may need to avoid sunlight if your eyes are acutely hurting, eventually part of the treatment is probably to get back out into the outside world where you will focus on things more than 10 feet away.<br><br>Also, any ADHD meds or other stimulants can make this effect worse.  I had to cut back on using Adderall because daily use will start to bring back the eye pain and headaches.  I imagine dextroamphetamine is preferably to the adderall formulations that have levo-amphetamine, but that&#39;s a bit out there. <br><br>And of course, it&#39;s possible none of these things are the source of your issue.  I looked at everything from MS to parasites to eye herpes.  And while I do think there was a big neuro-inflammatory/viral component given it started right after getting COVID, the entire  ecosystem is so complex that there&#39;s no point trying to parse it .<br><br>Basically my mistake was to listen to doctors who said &quot;normal eye strain wouldn&#39;t cause you this much pain&quot;.  Maybe that&#39;s true, but it was really the simple/healthy/holistic stuff- rest, &quot;fresh air&quot;, NSAIDs,ice packs, humidity, etc.    That helped way more than any of the tests the doctors tried.<br><br>Though I&#39;ll probably stay on Xidraa for a few months to give my eyes some extra protection while they continue to heal.<br><br><br>Good luck.  Sorry you&#39;re suffering.  People don&#39;t understand what a hell eye pain can be."

The vaccine (pfizer) is just the spike protein, but I felt the usual side effect the first week then felt better but then the second week was worse, way worse than the first week. I felt like I was have an allergic reaction and even my eyes were blurry and watery and I couldn&#39;t see properly. So I took antihistemine&#39;s and zinc and it sorted itself after 7 weeks.

Those subsided eventually, and came along with high blood pressure that was difficult to bring down and lasted for months.   It put me in the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù blood pressure category, wheny blood pressure was perfect before. I also got rashes across chest when the tongue was swelling.   Most of the symptoms aside from the eye symptom have subsided some.

2022-01-11T09:01:33Z,"@@zhkarma5491 My eyes were in constant pain, and, if I remember correctly then yes they would hurt a little more when I would move them.I just thought it was allergies so I wasn&#39;t paying that much attention. I do think I waited way, way too long to start putting eye drops in, though. I&#39;ve never really had to use eye drops so it wasn&#39;t something I just thought I needed to do right of the bat. I remember going into the drug store to get some but I was looking for some that didn&#39;t constrict the blood vessels (I learned that some eye drops just moisturize your eye but others will constrict the little veins in order to force the reduction of the redness. An eye doctor I spoke to recommended Systane Eye Drops so that&#39;s what I went with) Anyway, I remember being in the drug store and my eyes were in so much pain that I just had to hurry and get out. I put the eye drops in as soon as I got to my vehicle in the parking lot and it felt like HEAVEN. Since I left my last comment, my eyes have slowly started to get back to normal. and the floaters seem to be slowly disappearing. The Systane Eye drops worked great but I do wonder if the eye drops designed for pink eye may have been better. Anyway, hope that helps"

2021-03-25T22:28:51Z,"According to the official statistics, South Africa has turned into one of the greatest epicenters of Covid-19 in the world. Since the beginning of April to the 12th July, the cumulative number of infections in South Africa has doubled about every 14 days. On 12 July 2020, 264,184 cumulative cases have been recorded, slightly more than double the 131,800 on 28 June, 14 days before. South Africa was firmly on track to record half a million cumulative infections by 25 July. Community spread appeared unstoppable. At that rate of increase, 1 million would have been infected by 8 August, 2 million by 22 August, 4 million by 5 September, 8 million by 19 September, 16 million by 3 October and some 32 million by 17 October 2020. That would represent 53% of the population of over 59 million people. The daily number of new infections should then have dropped off steeply.  On that trend, over the first two weeks of October, between one and two million new infections were likely to occur daily. The growth of new cases in adjoining areas, such as Zimbabwe, Namibia, Eswatini, Botswana and Lesotho was much, much slower ‚Äì less than one-half to one-third the rate in South Africa.  But now, with the current wave in progress, the numbers in these countries are growing in proportion with numbers in SA. <br>On 13 July, the number of new cases in South Africa dropped significantly by about 1,440, or about 11%. The day before, the 12 July 2020, sales of alcoholic beverages were prohibited in South Africa, creating a false impression that the ban was the cause of the drop in numbers. However, this is false, because the normal lag period of some 5 to 10 days between the introduction of a new measure that is effective, and a reduction in case numbers, was completely absent, clearly identifying it as fake. This trend of a reduction of new cases continued daily and became progressively stronger. Today, 26 March, 2021, with a second (or third?) wave tapering down, the official cumulative number of cases in South Africa stands at 1,541,563 instead of well over 50% of the population, had the &#39;trend&#39; of doubling every 13 or 14 days continued. It had taken some 121 days to double to this latest number. There is no rational reason for a ban on liquor sales to cause such a sudden, steep drop in new cases. Hence the conclusion is that, over the three-and-a-half months before 12 July, the numbers have been manipulated up, as were the numbers on recoveries. Death numbers, on the other hand, were manipulated down: <a href=""https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2020-07-29-excess-deaths-soar-to-more-than-four-times-official-covid-19-toll-mrc-data-shows/"">https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2020-07-29-excess-deaths-soar-to-more-than-four-times-official-covid-19-toll-mrc-data-shows/</a> <br>The question is, why have the case numbers been manipulated up? <br>Early this year, South Africa applied for an IMF loan of US$4.3 billion at a very low interest rate. On 27 July 2020, the IMF publicly announced that the loan was granted -  <a href=""https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/07/27/pr20271-south-africa-imf-executive-board-approves-us-billion-emergency-support-covid-19-pandemic"">https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/07/27/pr20271-south-africa-imf-executive-board-approves-us-billion-emergency-support-covid-19-pandemic</a> Most likely, South Africa was informed of the grant earlier than the public announcement, perhaps around 12 July? Clearly, the numbers in South Africa have been manipulated up to impress on the IMF an urgent need for funds to fight the epidemic in the country. Most of the funds are likely to disappear into the pockets of corrupt people in positions of power and their family.<br>A further question is, what is the real motive for the ban on liquor sales ‚Äì back in July 2020 and again in early 2021? <br>The answer is that the ban on liquor sales will most likely drive many liquor stores out of business. The liquor trade is seen as lucrative, easy business. White owners of such businesses are exempt on a racist basis of financial assistance to weather the covid storm, including the IMF funds. Many of these businesses are likely to go bankrupt and be bought up at bargain prices by black politicians, their family members <a href=""https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-31-ace-magashules-sons-each-bag-a-free-state-covid-19-contract/amp/?__twitter_impression=true"">https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-31-ace-magashules-sons-each-bag-a-free-state-covid-19-contract/amp/?__twitter_impression=true</a> and other black business people, perhaps using some of the IMF funds paid for other contracts where contract prices have been loaded - <a href=""https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/covid-19-sahrc-set-to-probe-gauteng-health-spending-amid-corruption-claims-20200730"">https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/covid-19-sahrc-set-to-probe-gauteng-health-spending-amid-corruption-claims-20200730</a><br>And <a href=""https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-30-province-to-disclose-ppe-procurement-details-to-avoid-corruption/"">https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-30-province-to-disclose-ppe-procurement-details-to-avoid-corruption/</a><br>And <a href=""https://mg.co.za/coronavirus-essentials/2020-08-06-the-ppe-scandal-that-the-treasury-hasnt-touched/"">https://mg.co.za/coronavirus-essentials/2020-08-06-the-ppe-scandal-that-the-treasury-hasnt-touched/</a><br>Fraud and corruption assume many a guise. The South African government is rotten through from top to bottom and the people in power are out on the loot. They saw an opportunity and they jumped on it.  But at the same time, they are doing the South African population a grave disservice, endangering peoples&#39; lives and livelihoods -  subsequent waves of infections in South Africa are being masked by the huge false first wave. The statistics are being adjusted according to ulterior motives. Such as the opportunities a good crisis offers for personal enrichment. This time, however, the South African black elite defrauded and made fools of the international community, their co-members of the IMF, in addition to their own citizens ‚Äì perhaps strategically a grave error?<br><br>Only 5 months after South Africa was granted the USD 4.3 billion IMF loan (which comes to USD 71 per person in South Africa), the South African government cannot find the USD 4 per dose for the Astra Zeneca vaccine to vaccinate the population! <br>See <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6tBD3849o&amp;t=133"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6tBD3849o&amp;t=133s</a><br><br>See also:<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hq5qKNrs9c"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hq5qKNrs9c</a><br>And<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMP9MEmnoCo"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMP9MEmnoCo</a><br>And<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyRK3g4-HfE<br>And<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1gTSIbKbIw"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1gTSIbKbIw</a><br><br>Its all true!<br><br>But the cherry on top?? - South Africans like this one:<br>&quot;Samuel Makhetha 23 hours ago @Jan Viljoen no sir, a lot of Africans used their forefathers best method of killing all kinds of flu viruses, steaming using different natural herbs and I&#39;m one of them. No need to pay billions to sons and daughters of Colonialists who still have their own agendas of depopulation of black African people.&quot; <br><br>Not an isolated opinion either! And it takes just one half-civilised saboteur with similar views to leave a freezer door open or flick a switch and thousands of doses of vaccine are lost ‚Äì as recently happened in South Africa."

2021-03-25T20:37:21Z,"@@dantan1249 Oh boy, here we go...Botox is a name brand actually, and is the most popular choice of those who choose to inject botulinum toxin¬†a neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and related species. It prevents the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from axon endings at the neuromuscular junction, thus causing flaccid paralysis. It&#39;s a known side-effect that after Botox is injected, the eyes can become very irritated and dry, and can go quite bloodshot and red. This irritation can then increase into blurred vision and the inability to see correctly.  I cut and pasted this directly from the internet, so it must be true - just like those stories from ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, and CNN."

Over the past year, we have seen the foundation of our country irreversibly damaged. The unconstitutional Public Health orders in place have resulted in the permanent closure of countless small businesses, the declining mental health of adults and children, and the tainted reputation of Canadian Law Enforcement. A collective breaking point was reached by many in the police force as we saw Canadian‚Äôs fundamental human rights slowly stripped away. We signed up to act as beacons of truth, peace and integrity and we intend to hold fast to that conviction by shedding light on the unconstitutional nature of current Public Health legislations surrounding Covid-19. Along with our legal counsel, Rocco Galati, we will bring a Court order to the Superior Court of Ontario to clarify the constitutionality of the Covid-19 Public Health orders we are being asked to enforce.

Why is does he still have a job? Why do people like him and why is the news giving him air time? Unbelievable. <br>I ordered masks online as soon as i heard his lie. It didn&#39;t take away from healthcare workers like he claimed because they were not ordering mask from Wish. This virus has been used as a powergrab to take our jobs, businesses, homes and rights, even our children&#39;s education. How much could have been avoided by just saying wear a mask to protect yourself because something is better than nothing and other countries are reccomending wearing them for protection? We have been lied to, taken advantage of and have let our children suffer because of this incompetence. Compare the response of our country with our allies in how they have helped their people to survive this pandemic.

For example from amino acid 614 to 1133 is a 100% match to BatRaTG13 with the exception of a furin cleavage sequence.  How did that sequence that makes the virus much more infectious get there, and how would the rest of the sequence be a match to a lab sample from 2013, as the wild virus has mutated?<br>There are inserts in this virus from HIV-1, the AIDS virus and this virus targets T-cells like HIV.  That is why some people are asymptomatic and they are finding more organ damage in people without symptoms.  Also 25% of long haulers still had visibly suppressed immune systems after 9 months.<br>PS: Fort Detrick our bioweapons lab was shut down for extreme safety violations like not even wearing masks, much less proper gear around animals infected with bioweapons and doors leading out of the containment lab being propped open.  The military banned anybody who had ever tested positive from joining, like they knew."

2021-03-25T02:26:46Z,Deli Russ sounds like a quack.
2021-03-25T02:09:04Z,It&#39;s about time the fact you can catch a virus in your eyes is being promoted in America.

2021-03-25T02:06:50Z,The Chinese engineered virus is unknown about. There will be things that happen from this that will shock you! I&#39;m not getting the shot!!
2021-03-25T02:01:42Z,"COVID-19 (SARS-COV2) lives in aerosol form, can be transmitted through HVAC systems or floating on particles in dust storms &amp; is often introduced through our eyes, not our respiratory system. We&#39;ve known for over a year, this novel virus is not the expected revision of SARS 1 we were expecting, it primarily attacks our blood &amp; immune systems. I contracted it this way in March 2020, Dr. Jeffrey Fair (top immunologist)caught it the same way, a couple weeks later. Due to this a face shield in addition to a well-fitting facemask offers better protection than 2 or 3 facemasks. One of it&#39;s most consistent symptoms is not fever, it&#39;s O2 saturation levels which indicate impaired hemoglobin, not impaired pulmonary function. Save lives: use supplemental oxygen, not ventilators!"
2021-03-25T01:56:27Z,Everything that they‚Äôve said were aftermath issues related to Covid I have told all my doctors over a year ago was happening to me and no one would listen.
2021-03-25T02:52:36Z,"It&#39;s the same way with other diseases, Lyme Disease for example.  Some doctors have no interest in running tests or anything."
2021-03-25T03:00:04Z,It&#39;s because you are a liability* no dr wants to touch something they don&#39;t know nothing about. Until big pharma or scientists conduct more trails of treatment. Doctors today don&#39;t try to fix you they try to overmedicate you unfortunately and gets a hefty cent to do it.
2021-03-25T03:00:33Z,Keep those BORDERS OPEN with NO COVID checks and KEEP SPREADING this VIRUS..but AMERICANS must take a COVID TEST BEFORE AND AFTER FLYING...but if you WALK on ILLEGALLY its ok to KEEP SPREADING IT...WAKE UP AMERICA<br>...WAKE UP...this ADMINISTRATION is DESTROYING US..IN LESS THEN 2MONTHS
2021-03-25T03:00:51Z,@@WeylandLabs You have encapsulated my thoughts perfectly.
2021-03-25T03:29:07Z,@@ronnydisalvo80English is a language
2021-03-25T01:55:27Z,"Psychosis, tinnitus, lung scarring, and more! Yeah, no way this could be a man-made virus."
2021-03-25T02:07:46Z,"A mutating virus is not an evolutionary virus. Some videos have disappeared, but I suggest<br>you search You Tube for &quot;American scientist Wuhan virus&quot; to see more. It is a bio-weapon.<br>If that sounds strange don&#39;t forget that&#39;s how Europeans took over North, Central and<br>South America, spreading Dark Ages diseases as a form of genocide against the natives."
2021-03-25T02:08:13Z,Chinese engineered to collapse the world so they would be victorious!
2021-03-25T02:54:51Z,‚Äã@@johnwattdotca Thats true. Viruses dont mutate. Thats why all viruses are actually just the same virus and they dont want YOU to know THAT.
2021-03-25T03:20:44Z,"@@lordXAVIJAANBJERGNOG &quot;all viruses are actually just the same virus&quot;<br><br>This is a satire comment, right?"
2021-03-25T04:24:58Z,@@travisyee8739 You are a sharp one.
2021-03-25T01:47:22Z,It could be their confinement to their homes has just led to more Master  Bation and we know what that does to your eyesight.
