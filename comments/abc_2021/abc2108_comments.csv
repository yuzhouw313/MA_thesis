2021-12-13T00:04:57Z,MMM new evidence lovely jab up people its now moronic variant jab up people whoya
2021-10-26T20:26:24Z,"Seeing how natural immunity is far better and the government won&#39;t accept that and private corporations won&#39;t accept that, We can see it&#39;s all a game about making money and controlling people. We almost say no for them to stop."
2021-10-04T18:35:06Z,Weekly booster shots coming soon
2021-09-09T22:44:49Z,"He can do what he wants, better safe than sorry, but he probably won&#39;t go through the same thing again. At least not with a close cousin of the virus that got him."
2021-09-01T04:54:50Z,"Really? Because two top FDA officials quit because they are sick of the lack of care going into this vaccine program. If this was &quot;safe and effective&quot; then why are regulators quitting, scientists arguing and vaccinated people getting sick and dying?"
2021-08-31T22:36:59Z,"Now that many vaccinated people have waning immunity, they‚Äôll beg for the booster shots. What a great business strategy."
2021-08-31T17:27:25Z,The Biden administration doesn&#39;t know how to get the booster shots out. We were soooooooo lucky Trump was in office when this first started or this would have been so much worse.
2021-08-31T13:51:58Z,What a bunch of propaganda. Ben Stein took the booster shot and said it was the worst decision he ever made the side effects were horrible he thought he was dying but she won&#39;t find his video anywhere on YouTube white wash. Refuse the jab

2021-08-29T05:42:06Z,"&quot;THE VIRUS&quot; is not killing people, the &quot;LACK OF AN EARLY IN-HOME TREATMENT&quot; is responsible for the vast majority of deaths and hospitalizations.  Governments, the medical profession and mass media&#39;s covering up of the effectiveness of a proven and inexpensive prescription of IVM in treating &quot;THE VIRUS&quot; early on and in-home is clearly criminal and unethical.<br>   <br>For decades IVM has been used widely to treat parasites in humans, as well as the &quot;off label treatment&quot; of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus with minimal side effects.  IVM is also well known for it&#39;s antiviral properties and has now been proven to effectively treat &quot;THE VIRUS&quot;.  Ivermectin was discovered in 1975 and came into medical use in 1981 for humans.  It is on the World Health Organization&#39;s List of Essential Medicines.  Ivermectin is FDA-approved as an antiparasitic agent.  In 2018, it was the 420th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one hundred thousand prescriptions.  Additionally, IVM is used to prevent parasites in animals.<br>      <br>Think about it..... the medical profession is telling patients with &quot;THE VIRUS&quot; to just stay home and when your lips turn blue and you are hacking up hairballs, then come to the hospital for some treatment and medication.  Most Americans will look back on this Orwellian moment in history and wonder why we were so gullible.....<br>       <br>No matter what your stance on the vaccine or your political persuasion, every American (vaccinated, un-vaccinated, or previously infected) should have a prescription of IVM on the shelf and ready to use at the first sign of infection or re-infection.  Taking IVM early on in-home will significantly reduce severity of the disease, reduce hospitalizations and reduce mortality for the majority of patients.  IVM should have a significant role in treating &quot;THE VIRUS&quot; disease early on, especially now that so many folks are  becoming infected after being vaccinated, i.e. the breakthrough infections.<br>        <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C293FxZBK9w"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C293FxZBK9w</a>"

2021-08-28T22:19:51Z,The vaccine was so amazing that just a few months after getting it you need a booster.  Great job.

2021-08-28T21:28:21Z,CDC data shows a 99 percent recovery rate for people who are not vaccinated! <br>So if everyone gets Covid there will be 99 percent of us left! <br>99 percent no reason to get a untested vaccine! <br>99.997 percent recovery rate for people that are 18 years old and under!

2021-08-28T19:55:49Z,I would rather have some other agency other than the pharmaceutical companies talking about the value of a booster shot.  Obviously the pharm companies want you to take a booster because it increases their revenue.  Stories like this does not lend a lot of credibility of booster shots.

Also, taking ibuprofen too soon after vaccine decreases the amount of antibodies produced...not a doctor,  this is what they told me.

2021-08-27T16:12:29Z,If you get 2 covid shots and 8 months later you need a booster shot that tells me the 2  covid shots don&#39;t work.  I won&#39;t even think about a covid booster until at least a year after my first 2 shots. Next they wll tell you you need a 3rd booster in 3 months..

2021-08-26T13:20:19Z,"A groundbreaking preprint¬†paper¬†by the prestigious Oxford University Clinical Research Group, published Aug. 10 in The Lancet, includes alarming findings devastating to the COVID vaccine rollout.<br>The study found vaccinated individuals carry 251 times the load of¬†COVID-19¬†viruses in their nostrils compared to the unvaccinated.<br>While moderating the symptoms of infection, the jab allows vaccinated individuals to carry unusually high viral loads without becoming ill at first, potentially transforming them into presymptomatic superspreaders.<br>This phenomenon may be the source of the shocking post-vaccination surges in heavily vaccinated populations globally.<br>The paper‚Äôs authors, Chau et al, demonstrated widespread vaccine failure and transmission under tightly controlled circumstances in a hospital lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.<br>The scientists studied healthcare workers who were unable to leave the hospital for two weeks.¬†The data showed that fully vaccinated workers ‚Äî about two months after injection with the¬†Oxford/AstraZeneca¬†COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222) ‚Äî acquired, carried and presumably transmitted the¬†Delta variant¬†to their vaccinated colleagues.<br>They almost certainly also passed the Delta infection to susceptible unvaccinated people, including their patients.¬†Sequencing of strains confirmed the workers transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to one another.<br>This is consistent with the observations in the U.S. from¬†Farinholt and colleagues, and congruent with¬†comments¬†by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conceding COVID-19 vaccines have failed to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2.<br>On Feb. 11, the World Health Organization¬†indicated¬†the AZD1222 vaccine efficacy of 63.09% against the development of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The conclusions of the Chau paper support the warnings by leading medical experts that the partial, non-sterilizing immunity from the three notoriously ‚Äúleaky‚Äù COVID-19 vaccines allow carriage of 251 times the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to samples from the pre-vaccination era in 2020.<br>Thus, we have a key piece to the puzzle explaining why the Delta outbreak is so formidable ‚Äî fully vaccinated are participating as COVID-19 patients and acting as powerful Typhoid Mary-style super-spreaders of the infection.<br>Vaccinated individuals are blasting out concentrated viral explosions into their communities and fueling new COVID surges. Vaccinated healthcare workers are almost certainly infecting their coworkers and patients, causing horrendous collateral damage.<br>Continued vaccination will only make this problem worse, particularly among frontline doctors and nurses workers who are caring for vulnerable patients.<br>Health systems should drop¬†vaccine mandates¬†immediately, take stock of COVID-19 recovered workers who are robustly immune to Delta and consider the ramifications of their current vaccinated healthcare workers as potential threats to high risk patients and coworkers."

Japan plans to submit a tunnel construction plan to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by the end of next month with the goal of discharging contaminated water from the spring of 2023.<br><br> Previously, the Japanese government announced that there was no more space to store the contaminated water accumulated since the nuclear accident caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake in April 2011.  Since then, the authorities have considered discharging the contaminated water directly from the shore and discharging it through an undersea tunnel.  TEPCO plans to reduce the risk of radioactive materials by diluting and discharging contaminated water.  There is also an analysis that the decision was made with the external image in mind.  A Japanese government official told the Yomiuri Shimbun, &quot;It costs a lot to build, but the discharge through an undersea tunnel will give a better impression (for Japan).&quot;<br><br> Concerns are growing in neighboring countries including Korea and China due to Japan&#39;s discharge of contaminated water.  This is because tritium, a radioactive material, remains in the contaminated water even after purification, and it can flow into the oceans of neighboring countries.<br><br> Tritium, a radioactive material, is much smaller than a water molecule and has the same chemical properties, so it cannot be separated from water.  This means that if it is released into the sea, it will contaminate marine life as it is.<br><br> Tritium, which enters the body through food or air, such as ingestion of seafood, is fatal in that even a small amount can damage DNA.  When tritium pushes out normal hydrogen in the human body and causes nuclide conversion, the gene is modified and cells are destroyed, causing various cancers or lowering reproductive function.<br><br> There is concern that even if the concentration of pollution is lowered, the total amount will remain the same if released for a long period of time, adversely affecting the ecosystem.<br><br> If anxiety grows, the economy may suffer, such as a sharp drop in fish consumption in the market and a slump in the fishery industry.<br><br> Greenpeace, an international environmental group, suggested an alternative to storing tritium in a tank for a certain period of time and then releasing it when the level of contamination decreases, as the half-life of tritium radiation is halved by 12.3 years. <br><br>However, despite this, the Japanese government insists on ocean discharge for reasons such as cost...."
