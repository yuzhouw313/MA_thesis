2023-04-30T01:25:50Z,Prophetic
2023-03-16T01:08:48Z,Hey! First comment of 2023! Is it anniversary day for China Virus??
2022-09-12T13:13:04Z,It&#39;s kind of surreal to watch this now given how much Tucker would become a skeptic
2022-07-10T19:02:06Z,"I know I am 2 years late, but when did Tucker trust science?"
2022-03-10T16:44:12Z,This is still relevant after exactly 2 years.
2021-08-30T17:22:21Z,"If you‚Äôre reading this, never forget what happened on January 8, 2020 Al Asad airbase. Our troops were mercilessly attacked and neglected afterwards."
2021-07-17T03:45:40Z,"You were spot on when it comes to Coronavirus Tucker, keep up the great work."
2021-05-21T00:07:46Z,This was before conservatives knew Trump wanted them to stick their heads in the sand about COVID-19
2021-03-26T03:41:34Z,"Lora of good warnings here... that unfortunately became ALL TOO TRUE!. But saying the &quot;people that made us dependent on China for medical and other items&quot; should be held responsible.- means EVERY AMERICAN who shops at or encourages Walmart and ALL The others to keep prices down and buy from China!, i.e. ALL of our fellow Americans. It was NOT the &#39;Dems&#39; who allowed China business, but unabashed low-price sourcing that caused ALL our our dependence!  Tucker STOP Scapegoating  and name calling!  WE allowed EVERYONE to come in from everywhere without testing or isolation or even instructions... to mingle at will  China did not &quot;send&quot; the virus to us, anymore than the west wind across the Pacific is &#39;sent:  from China&#39; ! <br>Use your BRAIN ! !"
2020-10-07T01:48:24Z,"Tucker, you called it man. The powers at be hid the danger from us, and now over 200,000 are dead. Crazy."
2020-10-06T21:15:12Z,Thanks for falling into the Dems trap..... idiot
2020-10-04T00:06:24Z,"why is tucker say our leaders are the one minimizing  the effect of the virus . TRUMP is the one who was minimizing it, trump said it will miraculously disappear. IT WAS ALL TRUMP"
2020-10-03T11:07:17Z,"Well, 6 months down in October,  and Democrats are NOT rotting in hospital, whereas, the Orangeman and his cronies are festering in COVID juices! Maybe even GOD doesn‚Äôt like Republicans- f*cking dropping like flies- it‚Äôs called comeuppance! Love it!"
2020-09-26T00:20:58Z,THANK YOU TUCKER. You are &quot;THE PEOPLE&#39;S Reporter&quot;.  YOU TOLD THE TRUTH!
2020-08-06T02:10:31Z,"Watching this in August, it&#39;s clear Tucker was completely vindicated."
2020-08-03T19:20:11Z,"To Carlson‚Äôs credit, he was the first host on Fox who actually took COVID seriously and sounded the alarm. The rest of the talking heads naturally stuck with the party line until it turned up coughing at their doorstep."
2020-07-22T16:22:27Z,Was the pandemic THAT bad??
2020-06-22T04:44:04Z,The Chinese Coronavirus.
2020-06-22T04:43:23Z,500 cases.  This Douchebagg was denying it. Him and his Uncle Sean and Mark Levin and Rushbo.
2020-06-15T16:09:11Z,Just wait until the nation of these here United States of the Americas must has go on mandatory lock down. And March baseball madness say cancel of events??
2020-06-09T06:50:42Z,I bet his favorite food is Chinese food. Gtfoh
2020-06-02T04:09:54Z,lmao didn&#39;t fox news say early on that the corona virus was &quot;just a flu&quot; too??
2020-05-19T00:16:29Z,Did he just said that China is the most racist country in the world ?
2020-05-12T16:20:49Z,They&#39;re gonna play this video in history classes
2020-05-11T15:14:41Z,March Madness was cancelled?
2020-05-04T06:04:27Z,"Hey! I thought Trump was a good mate of President Xi. Referring to COVID-19 earlier this year, Trump said,  &quot;He (Xi) is working really, really hard.  They are very tough and very smart.&quot;  In the same video Trump then said, &quot;The relationship with China is a very good one.&quot;  The two mates had only just agreed on a new trade agreement.  There is no value in terminating a trade PARTNER when each RELIES on the other, but then Trump needed to blame someone for his abysmal response to the pandemic. China, WHO, a Democrat hoax, State Governors are on his hit list...I fear Fauci may be next.  God Bless America."
2020-04-23T14:07:10Z,The foresight of a gnat
2020-04-20T13:07:21Z,THE DOCTORS ARE STILL SAYING THE NUMBERS ARE WAYYYYYY   OFF. . THE NUMBERS SAY THIS VIRUS IS NOT EVEN AS BAD AS THE FLU.
2020-04-27T04:48:36Z,The numbers say this is way worse than flu.
2020-04-15T20:30:40Z,"Obviously it&#39;s not like the flu. You can be infected and spreading it without any symptoms for at least 4 days until symptoms finally show up. But, they didn&#39;t know that until recently."
2020-04-14T07:10:48Z,even a broken clock is right twice a day
2020-04-14T07:05:35Z,"i think every country is having a long hard look at its reliance on things made in china, the silver lining i suppose"
2020-04-10T08:23:09Z,"The only solution is extreme social distancing. If this is not implemented this will get far worse and millions and even billions will die.<br>All this business about the economy, they are crashing it on purpose.  If people are logical the economy won‚Äôt collapse, and we‚Äôll have a chance against the virus."
2020-04-07T04:42:30Z,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbyPW8lJX2E&amp;t=6m48s"">6:48</a> who made us so dependent on a hostile foreign power like china anyway? i wish he‚Äôd tell us"
2020-04-06T05:03:21Z,"Is he...saying that...trump didn&#39;t do anything for the US? Oh no...he did...he said this was a Hoax, nothing to worry...is so beautiful to have such an optimistic president."
2020-04-05T09:24:36Z,@ Bill Gates &amp; World Economic Forum ran @ Outbreak Simulation just 6 Weeks Before The Real Outbreak in China..... Hmmm...  What a coincidence?!
2020-04-05T09:24:26Z,I‚Äôm as left as it gets but I can respect real journalism.
2020-04-04T19:24:03Z,You just contradicted your self here April 4th about why we shouldn‚Äôt shut the country. Foolishish man
2020-04-04T02:47:24Z,Nobody listened to Tucker =(
2020-03-31T06:46:01Z,"Never miss your program, neverüëåüëåüëåüëåüëå"
2020-03-29T08:41:35Z,WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE.  WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE.  SO WHAT.
2020-03-29T00:43:11Z,DOUBLE FACE
2020-03-28T04:31:27Z,"I feel like this is a hundred years ago when he says that Italy has 100 deaths per day. Today Italy had 919 people die in one day and now we are on lockdown, borders are closed and the Olympics are cancelled and Tucker is quarantined for coronavirus exposure."
2020-03-22T11:17:26Z,"The government is the fault for this situation by its complacency, china lied to its citizens and the world with deadly consequences, and is not going to be held accountable. We are going to pay with our lives."
2020-03-22T11:05:08Z,We must remain calm says hysterical pansy-boy Tucker. <br>Talk to you in 3 weeks. You will be shutting yourself in the streets by then. We&#39;ll see who&#39;s racist by then. <br>Greetings from Geneva.
2020-03-21T23:28:50Z,Trump announced Europe travel ban after this video
2020-03-21T08:49:22Z,"Viruses have no passports, nor nationalities! And btw, what do you have to say about all the Europeans who brought all kinds of viruses to the native people of North America, and South America. Do you call those viruses &quot;European&quot; viruses??? Are you proud of your ancestors for bringing infectious diseases that killed thousands in the Americas? If the Chinese have to be blamed for something, it is for having live animal markets, i.e. &quot;wet markets,&quot; and having no animal welfare, and no animal cruelty laws. If those markets were shut down, there might be no covid-19, the same way that there might be no Ebola if African countries did not consume certain animals."
2020-03-20T19:49:19Z,"&#39;Our leaders need to prepare Americans for what&#39;s coming and mitigate the damage that China caused.&#39; How is a virus mutation a result of Chinese action? This could have just of easily started anywhere. This is a world problem not an issue of blame. As for why most items are produced there...economics. If you&#39;re happy to pay then U.S. drugs are available as are Swiss &amp; Norwegian but you&#39;ll pay twice the price because of the staffing costs. The most effective way of dealing with this is &#39;Herd Immunity&#39; but to see if this has been achieved, you&#39;ll need  &#39;Prick&#39; tests that look at specific Covid-19 IgG &amp; IgM and test everyone monthly."
2020-03-19T20:08:36Z,Don&#39;t say the naughty word
2020-03-19T12:41:36Z,Wait a minute‚Ä¶ I thought this whole thing was a liberal hoax?
2020-03-19T02:52:22Z,Thank you Tucker I feel you were the first on Fox to really take it this seriously.
2020-03-19T00:40:57Z,Tucker you&#39;re awesome...tell it as it is. üëçüëç
2020-03-18T14:43:28Z,In this worldwide pandemic crisis there will arise a leader with solutions to solve the world&#39;s problems . And the world will follow him. The ANTICHRIST will deceive many. I am a US NAVY VETERAN. Tucker is right. China is the enemy and I believe they will attack. But the real enemy is the Devil .
2020-03-18T07:49:40Z,Very fair coverage. both sides are idiots. Good work Tucker1
2020-03-18T05:37:52Z,When do we return the bioweapon to China? bs this was not planned.
2020-03-18T05:20:05Z,based and corona chan pilled
2020-03-18T04:00:53Z,Communists love to rewrite history when it serves their purposes. It‚Äôs what they do. They also just disappeared a Chinese billionaire who criticized Xi Kingpin. Tell me again why we should be trading with these people?
2020-03-17T15:49:25Z,I didn&#39;t like the sound of that threat... At all.
2020-03-17T15:34:23Z,"I&#39;m sorry, but that is extremely sick of China to threaten such a thing at this time, when they know darn well they are the cause of this. Downright evil. Shows they are not friendly toward us. Almost makes you question if they did this on purpose..."
2020-03-17T08:50:20Z,"In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one"
2020-03-17T07:05:12Z,Tucker is one of the only people in media who cares about every day Americans and is not just a shill for the elites
2020-03-17T03:06:08Z,Aliens dont come to earth as they fear being eaten by the chinese.
2020-03-16T22:02:31Z,Tucker is forced to promote the virus. BS
2020-03-16T16:47:59Z,This is must be god telling all the boomers its time to go.. Maybe to hell who knowable
2020-03-16T16:21:36Z,The damage Republicans have caused in the past 20 years is immeasurable
2020-03-16T15:18:03Z,Michael Scott was right
2020-03-16T14:44:45Z,Who is the people responsible?  Insurance CFO&#39;s. Tell us who to punish Tucker!
2020-03-16T14:03:05Z,Fool you are backward
2020-03-16T13:58:43Z,"The goal of this coronavirus BS is to collapse small and medium sized businesses; force people to live their lives in enclosed isolated spaces wasting their whole time away in front of a touchscreen; all food, goods and items are delivered by drones; and, in the end, otherwise install some form of technocratic communism once the economy collapses: So the trillion trillion dollar question is WHO BENEFITS????: Bill Gates and the technocratic elite, Chinese Communist Party, socialism, etc.... This is the dystopian future that is on the horizon."
2020-03-16T12:03:39Z,"As of 3-16-2020, COVID-19 has killed about 69 people in the US, <br> the regular FLU has already killed over 22,000 according to the CDC  - as it does EVERY YEAR.<br>DO YOUR RESEARCH PEOPLE - Don&#39;t buy into mass media HYSTERIA."
2020-03-16T08:43:28Z,"And the Democratic Party wants &quot;YOU&quot; to believe that Russia is the REAL problem! I&#39;m glad I&#39;m Woke since last year! Time to bring back &quot;Made in America!&quot; so &quot;We the People, of the United States of America&quot;, can thrive, as we did in the far past!"
2020-03-16T08:14:47Z,maybe it&#39;s time to start learn Chinese language
2020-03-16T07:57:19Z,Thank you for saying how it is
2020-03-16T06:09:33Z,Has Tucker been crying? His eyes look strange; I watch him a lot.
2020-03-16T04:52:11Z,"I said effectively the same thing regarding panic in a social media post and immediately slammed for it. While I understood some points being made, I was either incapable of properly expressing my point, or it was simply falling on deaf ears."
2020-03-16T02:09:27Z,"OMG - Tucker is saying it&#39;s better to always tell the truth. LOL that&#39;s a change for him. but I&#39;m sure his other Fox cohorts won&#39;t give up on their faux news agenda. Let this show you how serious this outbreak might be.  The great Trump is very gently being criticized by one of his own.  Doesn&#39;t happen often so when it does, hope you Fox listeners take it seriously.  Or like Devon Nunez suggested, go have a drink at the local bar.  Wtcrap - when you vote Republican now days it&#39;s just sad.  They don&#39;t care about America anymore so wise up."
2020-03-16T01:10:53Z,While we&#39;re being honest and Mr. Tucker I respect you for doing so. For all we know it could of been made in USA.
2020-03-16T00:15:00Z,"Corona virus a lie , go out to eat ,visit your elderly parents, live your life  !"
2020-03-15T23:44:11Z,Flu is 1 in a thousand<br>Cov-19 may be 3.4 in a thousand. <br>Is that 34 times more deadly?<br>Asking for a friend.
2020-03-15T23:10:44Z,Thanks Obama Biden
2020-03-15T20:14:28Z,"And yet, Still fewer deaths than people who had information on Hillary. ü§î"
2020-03-15T19:18:36Z,"No one really knows the mortality rate to be honest. What if someone had the virus but didn&#39;t report it and survived it? The 3% is inaccurate since no one has the real numbers. Also, Italy has a large elderly population, especially in the north."
2020-03-15T18:30:15Z,"I wonder if those dolts at YouTube are still demonetizing videos that mention Corona-Chan. ü§î If so, it‚Äôs a good thing this is made by Fox News."
2020-03-15T16:58:54Z,"I still think this is a hoax. I also think 75,000 tests are enough to help whole country. People on your network we‚Äôre pushing this so I believe it."
2020-03-15T15:43:30Z,You guys got nothing to do but complain...?!...üòèüòèüòè
2020-03-15T15:37:18Z,This is what we get depending on commies to make our stuff. This is why we need to end ALL trade with china. Wake up America!
2020-03-15T15:07:36Z,"The stats on COVID-19 are incomplete.  You can say it&#39;s 30 times more deadly than than flu if you want, but in time when more complete stats are gathered the percentages will decrease significantly."
2020-03-15T14:38:31Z,"How are we not taking recovered vs ded? When calculating stats for an early disease, we shouldn&#39;t assume total infected will all recover if bot ded already"
2020-03-15T13:45:13Z,"The problem with the mortality rate being quoted is that they say for instance 10,000 cases confirmed, 300 deaths therefore 3% mortality. But that is only tested and confirmed cases, many more are unconfirmed"
2020-03-15T11:53:31Z,We must remain calm.. So let&#39;s freak everybody out! üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
2020-03-15T11:20:54Z,Coronavirus is a joke. I‚Äôm not even convinced it‚Äôs real.
2020-03-15T10:03:14Z,The number of times the Flu killed me is 0 <br>0 x 34 = 0  This is the amount the Corona Virus will effect my life.
2020-03-15T10:00:20Z,I&#39;m starting to get the idea that Tucker doesn&#39;t like Chinese people
2020-03-16T23:48:09Z,"Hate the Chinese Govt not the people, many of the people are just like you and me trying to get through the day."
2020-03-17T02:22:02Z,We are  at war
2020-03-17T06:33:23Z,who cares. They don&#39;t like us either
2020-03-15T05:42:36Z,As a half Chinese I can confirm that we are the most racist people on earth.
2020-03-16T17:40:00Z,Jason Pham ...and your better half is telling you to go live in China.
2020-03-18T00:56:03Z,Well the dems seem to profit and benefit from it. What&#39;s that tell you?
2020-03-18T02:16:24Z,Herculydia are you even listening to what you‚Äôre saying? The only ones benefiting are short traders and big corporations off people‚Äôs stupidity
2020-04-04T18:13:09Z,"Well, that&#39;s why you&#39;re only half... human"
2020-04-04T18:24:54Z,"@@Joshuaaa245 Can&#39;t we all just get along ? Josh i was an agent for a brokerage firm in commodities. Saw enough corruption, lies and scam profiting to leave the industry and make an even buck without rubbing shoulders with Piranha &amp; criminals. Saw $100&#39;s of thousands lost by good people monthly. Now i work for living. Peace out."
2020-03-15T05:12:38Z,&quot;...people you trust and voted for&quot;??? Tucker seems to be implying that the president has been either deceitfully or ignorantly misleading about the seriousness of the situation!  I say he should go work for CNN along with that sly DemonRat Chris Wallace.
2020-03-15T04:46:40Z,You thought Buddah was a joke.  He made it happen LoL
2020-03-15T04:40:59Z,China just needs to be liberated from the CCP. TRUMP FOR CHINESE PRESIDENT 2020
2020-03-15T04:38:24Z,The coronavirus makes your &quot;extortion from China&quot; video have more meaning!!!
2020-03-15T03:59:21Z,"We should have never put are selfs to be reliant on another country for anything. Ive told people , but no Im a close minded  racist . Enjoy your globalism and diversity when your love ones are dying."
2020-03-15T01:51:04Z,Fox news pushing the propaganda too...
2020-03-15T00:32:57Z,"Well to start with why don&#39;t we stop lying about it being called the Chinese coronavirus, because it was Canada who created the virus and had it in a biological weapons facility, and probably a handout from a US biological weapons agency most likely,  the rest of the world already knows it came from the US, but one thing that you can count on is the people of the US won&#39;t be getting cure handed out to them"
2020-03-14T23:54:11Z,we should invade china and take over the factories and create china 2.0
2020-03-14T23:37:19Z,Thanks Nixon.
2020-03-14T22:11:28Z,Greed pushing our manufacturing overseas. America use to make solid products that didn‚Äôt break after a few uses. Hell we have building that took 3-4 round of dynamite before going down and some didn‚Äôt fall from that and had to be taken down piece by piece. We can traded power for money and are now seeing how bad it is and how much worse it could get.
2020-03-14T20:51:59Z,HAHA I&#39;m proxying thru U.S.MONTANA CALIFORNIAAND UTAH AND GRABDMA SAY CHINA STINKY BUTTS ON WHEELS. SLAMMED JAMMED HAMMED N THANK U MAMMED<br><br>RODOTODO BIG BOI IN DA PHOTO.
2020-03-14T17:31:40Z,Straight up is better than the lies. Keep up the straight talk Tucker!
2020-03-14T17:16:56Z,‚ÄúA country that hates‚Äù lol I think USA hates chine first lol <br>‚ÄúDamage that they are causing us‚Äù<br>I think the USA did all the hurting first and now we are paying for it. Ask your president. He is probably graving some pu s s y as the apocalypse is getting closer
2020-03-14T17:09:47Z,Why tucker after this epsiode is <br> Named it chinese corona virus. The whole month prior it was just corona virus. Always dividing ppl. There is alot of vigilantes out here in NYC attacking Asian is sad there ppl like Tucker iut there. You will never hear Hanitty say Chinesse corona virus
2020-03-14T16:34:43Z,"Tucker, for Jesse Watters to fan anti-Chinese sentiments, people know that he is dumb and shallow. But for you, the smart one to go so low to condemn China?  Why blame everything on China?  Your giant American corporations buy $1.00 from China factory and sell for $50. Who makes all the profits? Your Wall Street smart guys suck up all the average American families&#39; money, blame China again? Your govt is protecting the American giant corps.  Never for once, your favourite politician tells you that the selling price of a Made-in-USA will be 20 to 50 x higher than not just products from China but India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Africa, Korea and even Japan, Mexico, Brazil. American consumers will have to pay much higher Retail price and the giant Americans will have lesser profits or find themselves unable to retail at high prices. There are better ways to prosper USA than to put the blame totally on one country."
2020-03-14T16:10:16Z,"Tucker, The Chinese Coronavirus? What about The American H1N1? H1N1 killed more than 500,000 people!!"
2020-03-14T15:55:17Z,I am surprised tucker drifted away from the presidents opinion that this was a hoax and no big deal . I guess his comments finally got the president to come around but I think he still believes we will be out of the woods by April . Markets finally saw government working on the problem (the virus ) than the symptom ( the economic consequence ) and this lifted markets and maybe that will help Trump to understand .  Fox knows they have the presidents ear and they have a responsibility to give him a kick in the butt to see reality . We are all in this together and blaming who and what is not productive . There will be plenty of that after its over . Its to bad most did not save for a rainy day
2020-03-14T15:51:21Z,Corporate greed will be our undoing.
2020-03-14T15:28:43Z,it was completely irresponsible for trump to shut down the offices and agencies that had been put in place to plan for and combat these types of outbreaks with the excuse to drain the swamp and save money now we see how shortsighted and ridiculous it is when people denigrate the government then complain it hasn&#39;t done enough...remember it was Reagan that said government is the problem....not so anymore eh?
2020-03-14T15:15:43Z,"Many are stating the reason why the elderly with conditions are dying it‚Äôs due to so many medications they are taking, including flu shots!!"
2020-03-14T13:44:01Z,I&#39;m not a fox news viewer..but he is correct. Well said. Let&#39;s just hope we get a handle on it before it gets worse. We have got to help our fellow citizens out.
2020-03-14T12:44:49Z,Dems finally found somthing that will work aginst Pres Trump .
2020-03-14T12:00:05Z,"Tucker: Don‚Äôt panic, but PANIC!!<br><br>Oh, and FUK China!"
2020-03-14T09:35:09Z,Don‚Äôt spread hatred
2020-03-14T08:10:38Z,Ahh I love it the end of Globalism as we know it
2020-03-14T07:53:45Z,Who&#39;s down to rename the Coronavirus the Chinci Bat Soup Flu?
2020-03-29T12:23:58Z,I prefer CCP Virus
2020-03-14T06:28:38Z,Nuke China. Got it
2020-03-14T05:55:34Z,It didnt come from a meat market it was a level 4 lab located in wuhan the meat market is just an easy patsy.
2020-03-14T05:46:13Z,"Corona virus will pass. And when it does, we will feel foolish for not realizing that sooner."
2020-03-14T05:36:00Z,So who all deserves to be punished for America&#39;s &quot;supine position&quot; to China?
2020-03-15T14:45:14Z,"Brian de Riancho You doggone right. Including the orange clown.  Some worse than others.  There is no one in the Whitehouse, Senate, Congress or Fortune 500 innocent in the past 50-60 yrs. Every time you sign or vote for something you don&#39;t pay for you&#39;re guilty one way or another."
2020-03-15T14:57:19Z,Brian de Riancho Wow. Thought we were vibin&#39;. I&#39;ve been alive for all six. That&#39;s not true at all. Both the deficit and debt are increasing with the new spending of this administration.  They&#39;re part of the problem.
2020-03-15T15:47:14Z,Brian de Riancho We definitely see some things the same and others different.
2020-03-14T05:32:59Z,Nice to se an honest assessment on fox for a change
2020-03-14T05:23:36Z,we should nuke china and get it over with already
2020-03-14T04:29:47Z,"Fox growing a conscious, lol. Or war with China."
2020-03-14T04:24:52Z,Decent segment
2020-03-14T03:54:32Z,Not all people can work from home
2020-03-14T03:50:50Z,"So much BS, the reality is that thousands die on the highways every day because of Wreckless and Careless drivers but our polititians won&#39;t deal with this problem."
2020-03-14T03:40:08Z,"He&#39;s right, it&#39;s not JUST the flu, its the flu with respiratory issues. It&#39;s not comparable to the average flu, but is comparable to H1N1 aka swine flu. He mentions Italy, but not the fact that the population of Italy has a higher percentage of older citizens since the younger ones usually leave to other countries to make a future, which was reported on years ago. <br>He is right, we do need to remain calm about it, but I believe he also is causing a bit of extra fear. Some people need that dose of fear though as plenty of people have been oblivious for way too long and have not at all been preparing for whats been happening and could further spread the virus to people that are more susceptible to its harsher effects. With this virus we need to remain calm and alert or else it will be exactly like another swine flu."
2020-03-14T03:33:56Z,Truth from fox news. The end days are here this week
2020-03-14T03:21:31Z,Ugh great after hearing this piece I think things are only going to get worse.   If Tucker is right then we are going into a deep depression.
2020-03-14T02:28:35Z,Chines stop eating bats
2020-03-14T02:17:57Z,Fox gives you the facts.  And that is what we all need at this moment in time
2020-03-14T01:58:43Z,This is the first FoxNews segment I agree with. Wow. It‚Äôs actually fair and balanced... like it‚Äôs supposed to be! No BS. Appreciate this.
2020-03-14T01:51:12Z,Thanks Tucker.
2020-03-14T01:37:46Z,"Back when America used to make its own stuff and not ship off work to countries where they eat bats and rats, we didn&#39;t have these problems!!"
2020-03-14T00:46:05Z,Ok Tucker so it wasn&#39;t developed at the University of North Carolina doing gang of function research!
2020-03-14T00:21:48Z,tucker has good points
2020-03-14T00:09:21Z,"India makes medicines and very cheap too. We do not actually need china for nothing. We can just as easily move our business over and watch their country starve out once they get left with zero things to import here. We have needed to make our own products for a very long time but in the end, china should of been cut out of the picture 50+ years ago. Stop buying made in china rubbish."
2020-03-13T23:49:24Z,"Just wait till the 1% figure out that due to this Coronavirus pandemic, the United States of America will cancel the 2020 presidential election. Therefore, President Donald J. Trump will remain in office as the President of the United States for the next four years. In addition, for his compensation for filling in and performing his duties and responsibilities as President, he will be entitled to run for a third term in the 2024 presidential election.<br>(Now let‚Äôs start the clock and see how fast this pandemic is cleared up and cured....)"
2020-03-13T23:33:45Z,You will get it Bucky. Cheers!
2020-03-13T23:33:00Z,The Chinese should be held accountable for what they&#39;ve done.
2020-03-15T03:28:00Z,This was a crispr gene edited virus made deadly in a lab... released on purpose
2020-03-15T06:10:41Z,@@UnseenThreat07 by who? the dems? gates?
2020-03-13T23:21:23Z,There hasn&#39;t been enough cases to compare it to the flu.
2020-03-13T22:52:07Z,We gotta start manufacturing everything again. No more reliance on China <br><br><b>MADE IN THE USA</b> üá∫üá∏
2020-03-16T14:03:40Z,Maga hats are made in China
2020-03-19T09:52:56Z,Kiyan Sharifian the real ones are made right here in the USA.. or you can buy a fake Chinese one
2020-03-13T22:48:32Z,Bring the manufacturers back home!
2020-03-13T22:34:17Z,Stop the fear mongering.
2020-03-13T22:31:41Z,"Stop buying Chinese,  even Coronavirus."
2020-03-13T22:15:57Z,"This is loaded with opinion, heavy reaction and fear-mongering, which is fuel to the fire.  Stop it."
2020-03-14T01:44:11Z,I didn‚Äôt say anything about Tucker being incorrect.
2020-03-13T21:53:30Z,I&#39;m more worried about the mass hysteria than the virus itself. Once martial law takes place all hell breaks loose.
2020-03-13T21:50:28Z,The powers that be are licking their lips. Two birds with one stone. *Vigorous hand rubbing intensifies*.
2020-03-13T21:44:27Z,Kids around America are probably celebrating that they get to play videogames all day until school reopens.
2020-03-13T21:21:15Z,Comparing the annual number of flu deaths to a PERCENTAGE who die from this virus is a sleight of hand.  Shame on you Tucker.
2020-03-13T21:12:58Z,"The first time i heard about novel covid 19, all i could think was it sounds like the opening salvo to a larger asssult especially when considering historical actions like the boxer rebellion."
2020-03-13T21:09:16Z,"Guys, this is a MAJOR HISTORICAL EVENT that we&#39;re living through. When this subsides, you can bet that it will result in major changes to society. History students 50-100 years from now will see videos of us scrambling to prepare for this."
2020-03-26T03:17:16Z,infinteuniverse I agree. The poor Detroit Police Department lost members :-( One detective was just 38.
2020-03-13T20:53:38Z,Your military wont save you now America. <br>Perhaps you could try yelling at the virus with you big mouth and see if that works.
2020-03-13T20:49:55Z,"If our moronic president hadn&#39;t disbanded the presidential pandemic response division, or tried to deflate the number of cases to protect his reelection chances, maybe this country would be in a better place. f*** Trump"
2020-03-13T20:45:32Z,Prepare America. You&#39;re about to suffer the worst economic failure you&#39;ve ever seen. There will be no medical care for you because the big corporate health providers are about to collapse.  Good luck.
2020-03-13T20:07:44Z,It‚Äôs Weird seen this man actually taking no sides
2020-03-15T03:49:41Z,"Why, he does it quite often"
2020-03-13T20:03:48Z,"Why dont you report the real news , trump is unfit to serve ,  how trump personally stonewalled testing for 2 months , and china declaring the trump administration has perpetrated an act of war upon them and what happened. To it being a hoax ?? How the the oil collaspe is going to collapse the dollar by design"
2020-03-13T19:56:13Z,Looks like we need to call in Team America for one last mission! <br>But CCP is hoping that it&#39;s rivals strike first so they can claim the high ground when they strike back. <br>This is why we need Team America to surgically drop in to unseat the head of the dragon. I&#39;d say only a few key party members would topple the whole thing.
2020-03-13T19:35:13Z,"Writing from Italy. The problem here is for the moment psycological. The speed of the expansion is frighting and it is what is worse. In Italy we can handle it but with such a speed of expansion it ends up crowding the hospitals which is the real problem! To many people to be cured at the same time. To this, besides  the health and econimical problem, nobody seems to think about public riots. I hope no disorders occur due to panic. Psycologically it is tough because you seem not to see a quick end to the problem."
2020-03-13T18:52:04Z,"I hate to be a conspiracist, but isn&#39;t it odd that this virus is particularly going after the older folks? Isn&#39;t it a coincidence that people generally become more conservative as they grow older and more experienced? I pray this is not the case."
2020-03-13T18:37:44Z,This guy is going totally crazy now.  He is going all the way to blame every problem in the world on China now.
2020-03-13T17:13:50Z,"anyone remember the swine flu it happened 10 years ago - 17,000 americans died, 1,800 children - it hit the kids and young adults up  to 65 years old.  No panic no shut downs because their was no hype from the media anyone see something going on here?  I think this is media and dem driven to help them polictically.  No why there was no hype with the swine flu Obama was president and he owned the media.  This Cororna virus is the flu anyone older or with respiratory problems will have a problem but,  older adults always have to watch, their frail if a cold or the regular flu hits they have problems and guess what --41,000 people died from the flu in 2018.  Anyone here this in the media?  No, never mentioned.  What are we panicking for?  Learn, protect yourself as much as you can and get on with your life!!  Also, I heard two places are working on a vaccine.  Stop being afraid the economic reprecussions from this will be far greater because of the media hype!! Learn from it, let&#39;s produce our own medicines!"
2020-03-13T16:53:52Z,My worry is that they are going overboard with this stuff and at faster rate than they should. I went back last night and did some research on past &quot;viruses&quot; or &quot;illnesses&quot; this country has dealt with. We dealt with this in the Obama administration...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I&#39;m not bashing Obama here...‚Ä¶.this kind of thing should be above politics......and I have noticed we are acting 100 times faster and 100 times stronger! Not just with Obama but with the last 4 times we have dealt with this it has not received such a MASSIVE reaction! NBA season is canceled. That&#39;s a lot of money in the economy. March Madness is canceled. That&#39;s a lot of money. So many people are staying home that many small businesses across the country are closing their doors until people start coming out of their homes. If we are not careful we can tank our economy in a heartbeat! I went to my favorite steak house yesterday and it is closed due to the virus. I&#39;m not saying we are or are not. I&#39;m saying that I&#39;m beginning to wonder if we are not taking this too far based on what has happened so far. There are now millions of people out of work!
2020-03-13T16:14:20Z,"You mean the &quot;Wuhan&quot; Virus? <br>Because its from China by either &quot;Accidental&quot; release or On Purpose as a Weapon, who knows for sure? Because the Chinese government sat on the knowledge of the coming Pandemic they released into Wuhan for 1 or 2 months and, actively persecuted the Chinese Whistleblower who tried to warn U.S..<br>Because that delay of information guaranteed the Wuhan Virus would be contracted by millions of their own people Partying in the streets during the Chinese New Year (their largest celebrations).<br>Because the Chinese government &quot;Allowed those Infected Citizens and visitors to leave China to spread the Wuhan virus Worldwide .<br>Question: Why is China&#39;s Criminal Act of Mass Negligent Homicide being &quot;Glossed&quot; over?<br>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$?????<br>And, who in and out of Our Governments are in the Chinese Government&#39;s pocket?"
2020-03-13T16:04:04Z,Tucker Carlson can go to hell!!!
2020-03-13T13:15:56Z,"The sheep have all run into shops shouting bahh baaahhh and bought up every scrap of food, police called and fighting in the shopping isles. and they call themselves civilized??? These people as we know all live on the left side of the street and believe every word that the government say. Vaccines are coming for them all."
2020-03-13T12:18:45Z,A recession is definitely coming. Economists predicted that even before everyone even heard of COVID-19.
2020-03-13T12:04:53Z,I&#39;m a progressive and watch Tucker. On a personal note thank you for having Tulsi Gabbard on your show often. Thank you for your reporting on the virus. We need to have manufacturing jobs here.
2020-03-13T10:49:41Z,Listening to our inept president prattle about containing the Coronavirus pandemic is like listening to him lecture on topic of marital fidelity. Our inept President fired the pandemic response team that Obama assembled in 2015. Trump&#39;s malfeasance is harming everyone in the USA
2020-03-13T09:22:00Z,I KNEW TUCKER WAS A GUY I LIKE EVEN AS A LIBERAL LIKE ME. HE CALLING BOTH SIDES OUT.
2020-03-13T09:19:40Z,Even Tucker is calling the Republicans out on that BS Hoax Trump was stating. This is the second time Tucker has questioned Trumps presidency.
2020-03-13T09:18:25Z,Australia is giving cash to citizens;  U. S. senators go on recess.
2020-03-13T08:31:29Z,TRUMP IS A TRAITOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2020-03-13T07:46:15Z,"TUCKER, YOU HAVE JUMPED THE FENCE, AND ARE SHILLING FOR THE OTHER SIDE. SHAME ON YOU.<br>I HAPPILY UNSUBSCRIBED, BECAUSE YOU HAVE GONE THE WAY OF DRUDGE.<br>ADIOS, FORMER AMIGO!"
2020-03-13T07:38:38Z,"Notice how Tucker goes out of his way to portray Democrats as malicious yet when he admits that the Republicans have minimized the threat, he says they do it out of good intentions. Can you imagine how he would react if it was a Democrat and not Trump who compared it to the flu?"
2020-03-13T05:51:54Z,"China has infected the world...eating rats, mice, bats...crazy! In 2002 China also gave us SARS,  and now Corona virus 2019...Who knows what other virus might come out of China."
2020-03-13T05:11:22Z,"We should band together with the other NATO members to create our own trading block and kick China to the curb. If people cheat, they lose their NATO security guarantee."
2020-03-13T04:37:17Z,Joe Rogan is also amazing and he has over 3 million more subscribers than Fox. He always tries to take the side of the truth.
2020-03-13T04:14:46Z,"I can‚Äôt believe Fox let the guy make the speech.  The virus could happen anywhere, it‚Äôs not made in China. US has built its strength by globalization and its diversity, and we need help from China now than anytime. This hostility and racism won‚Äôt help this country at all. We need to save people, not to find the goat."
2020-03-13T03:54:10Z,"Sorry Tucker but I call BS. It&#39;s way too early to conclude that COVID19 is deadlier than the flu. I have a suspicion that a lot more people than anyone realizes have already contracted it and didn&#39;t report because they though it was the common cold. Therefore the number of deaths in relation to the number of reported cases seems way higher than it actually is. <br><br>20,000 people have died of the flu in the US this year alone."
2020-03-13T03:22:13Z,WE&#39;RE ALL GONNA DIE  !!!!!!!!!!!!!

2020-03-13T02:56:47Z,"For what ever reason I think to hear Tucker Carlson say this is going to be bad, is worse then hearing the CDC say more or less the same thing."
2020-03-13T02:51:52Z,Zombies ...lol
2020-03-13T01:47:08Z,Thank you Tucker
2020-03-13T01:36:07Z,"Tucker is freaking awesome. Bringing the news like a boss. Debates against dems like a savage. Most patriotic news cast iv seen. Obviously this comment will offend dems. My b, i honestly don&#39;t care"
2020-03-15T06:36:40Z,Healso roasted trump for downplaying the virus ! He said it was all a hoax!!
2020-03-13T01:31:45Z,"Vox news, a prominent liberal media outlet, explicitly blamed China‚Äôs corruption for the outbreak. I think red and blue both are blaming China."
2020-03-13T01:19:03Z,Tucker is a TRAITOR and a COMMUNIST who should be investigated by the TRUE PATRIOT! Coronavirus is a  fraud HOAX by the DEEP STATE to spread panic. NO ONE HAS DIED!! NOT ONE AMERICAN HAS DIED! I <br><br> I STOPPED the virus!  MAGA MAGA MAGA!  I&#39;M DOING GREAT! #1!
2020-03-13T01:08:49Z,"When is someone going to say what we already very well know: COVID-19 or the coronavirus is heaven sent to (manufactured by) the Democratic Party to unseat President Trump. Because they realize that Mr. Biden is such a laughable joke, they need to create the illusion that any ill affects of the coronavirus in America are attributable to President Trump. They‚Äôll stop at nothing even if it means the US economy fails and we become weaker as a nation. Never mind that the coronavirus has been around since the early 1960s, notwithstanding the current strain is anecdotally more communicable and potent than the annual typical flu virus. Wake up America and stop being manipulated by the media and political hype! Wash your hands of China and invest in America!"

2020-03-13T01:00:06Z,When is the USA and the rest of the world going to call out and boycott China for creating these viruses by allowing wild game farming sanctioned by the communist government?
2020-03-13T00:57:03Z,"Guys: CDC JUST ANNOUNCED 16000 peoples died from the flu, part of it confirmed was CORONAVIUS<br>PLUS, how you know was not from us America? Please fox, learn to be human..mankind!  Most important at this most is to save lives"

2020-03-13T00:46:40Z,"These big cities, huge corporations, Wall Street, etc.. all are panicking. Meanwhile, the common man from the Midwest and the South who live paycheck to paycheck are more conditioned to this and panic less. When it all comes crashing down we‚Äôll be standing, trapping, hunting and growing like we‚Äôve done for generations and generations and we‚Äôll grit our teeth, break our back and feed the same man who threw hate our way and called us deplorable.

2020-03-13T12:02:26Z,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying.
2020-03-13T00:45:32Z,"We must learn from this and start cutting ties with China...less business, less travel, less immigration, less relations."
2020-03-13T00:23:06Z,There‚Äôs literally no reason to call it the ‚ÄúChinese Coronavirus‚Äù other than to scapegoat all Chinese people and redirect blame from Trump tanking the Dow Jones with his incompetence handling the coronavirus outbreak here in the United States. Pretty sure COVID 19 doesn&#39;t have a nationality.
2020-03-13T21:45:48Z,"They called it the Wuhan virus, because that&#39;s where the bio lab that it leaked from is. It&#39;s not racist, you just have a case of the tds virus."

2020-03-13T00:14:35Z,WOW!  Tucker finally tells the truth!
2020-03-12T23:53:30Z,Why the hell isnt the CDC releasing the testing for this new virus. How the hell will we know how the virus is traveling around. What is wrong with you people. Ask the relevant questions.
2020-03-12T22:58:17Z,It&#39;s great to hear something sober.
2020-03-12T22:45:02Z,This is what happens when you rely on China. Dammit Nixon!
2020-03-12T22:13:33Z,"It&#39;s best to tell the truth, but very few can handle it. Jack was right."

2020-03-12T21:48:03Z,I‚Äôm really freaked out that for once I agree with him and his logic. People need to open their eyes to what‚Äôs happening.

2020-03-12T21:16:12Z,"Today just a few hours ago, I had to make a trip to a certain large store. Whether or not you must be deplorable to attend is questionable. And as I crossed the parking area, and as I walked thru this store, I made sure I concentrated on the visuals I hoped and I thought I might see. Would people be doing this or that. Would there be people. And so as I stood in line I notice -----finally a lady that had in her hand a bottle of rubbing alcohol and a bottle of clear hand sanitize. And after she spoke to the person of degree and knowledge, just a few short steps from doing everything she could, yes, she rubbed her face.  I was shocked, not by that, but nobody had any PPE on. None. I was expecting anything and all things. Yes usually there is a person or 2 wearing a flu mask(?) But not even this. Amazing. Not what I (thought) a pandemic would look like. I would say it was more in line with a low hurricane watch."
2020-03-12T20:50:18Z,Love this guy

2020-03-12T18:40:26Z,Hey I cannot find the ‚ÄúChina issues warning to US‚Äù article Tucker is referencing about export bans from their ‚Äúofficial news source.‚Äù Could anyone share the source with me please and thank you.
2020-03-12T18:24:31Z,If we were ready with testing at least those who get through it can go back to work
2020-03-12T17:52:08Z,The president said that the numbers would go down! Why are they going up?
2020-03-12T17:40:49Z,Most honest person in cable news. We don‚Äôt agree on everything but I can say he‚Äôs the most honest.
2020-03-12T17:31:54Z,I cannot stand nor trust you but you&#39;re actually choosing to live in reality like an actual adult. Thank you for that!

You can&#39;t go anywhere because no one is allowing your diseased nation to travel.  Fortunately, Taiwanese have NOT been restricted.  Why? because they know we are not part of the PRC.  Enjoy ;)"

2020-03-12T12:18:54Z,"I live in northern Italy.  Reports are true, except, at least in our city, people don‚Äôt seem to be curtailing activities whatsoever.

We‚Äôre supposed to carry documents showing purpose for being out, but no one‚Äôs checking those.  Public doesn‚Äôt seem to be taking it too seriously."

2020-03-12T06:03:57Z,"Tucker, I love your show and respect you probably more than every other Fox News analyst. However, I must disagree with you on promoting the mass hysteria about Coronavirus. I‚Äôm a primary care physician on the front lines of care. Our office cannot order basic supplies because of all the hysteria and misinformation that has been perpetuated by the media. As a regular viewer of Fox, this episode surprised me. CORONAVIRUS is a serious concern, but I and many other healthcare professionals disagree with the escalation of our counties infatuation with promoting this panic. CORONAVIRUS is a very big concern and we can‚Äôt anticipate it‚Äôs course. What we do know is that influenza has caused more illness and deaths in the US. This has been the worse season in over a decade. Please keep this in perspective. It‚Äôs not all about ratings, but facts.<br>God bless. Keep fighting for us conservative Americans."

2020-03-12T05:24:31Z,Truth. The media fear mongering with the panic and paranoia they cause will end up being far worse than the virus. Peace.
2020-03-12T05:21:49Z,Tucker always spot on
2020-03-12T04:48:51Z,Don&#39;t panic but be prepared just in case

2020-03-12T03:53:02Z,"Really stupid for China to be threatening the US at this time. We need to create incentives to bring manufacturing back to the US. Greedy corporations need to be smacked up-side the head. After all, corporations are people, right?"

2020-03-12T03:32:35Z,So the leftwing media was more accurately stating the seriousness of the virus while Trump and most of the talking heads at Fox News have been downplaying it. Good that Tucker is actually being honest about the seriousness of it even it goes against the FOX&#39;s normal rightwing agenda.
2020-03-12T03:25:17Z,Tucker Nailed it üíØ! He is keeping it REAL!

As someone who is proud of their Chinese roots, I&#39;m able to separate my ethnicity from my nationality. A desire to protect ourselves from the Chinese government&#39;s influence is not racist."

2020-03-12T00:09:03Z,Kudos to you Tucker Carlson for telling the American people the truth regarding the coronavirus and how it is and will affect us.
2020-03-11T23:56:21Z,We should start seeing this headline a lot. &quot;Healthcare System Overwhelmed in {YOU PICK THE COUNTRY}&quot;
2020-03-11T23:54:46Z,"Wow without the weight of all the tourists Venice isn&#39;t sinking anymore at least to judge by the video you showed. You know the 1% mortality amounts to like 50,000 people not insignificant, corona virus or not."
2020-03-11T23:51:50Z,Whelp now it‚Äôs a pandemic
2020-03-11T23:48:49Z,"Not all that bad, at least you called out both political parties. But the citizens of the United States need to call out the CDC, the last official number I have seen is 4865 tests for this virus performed in the United States. That is over a period of 45-50 days, South Korea is performing 10,000 tests every day. If the CDC ever relaxes their testing criteria you will see cases skyrocket in the USA, if they try to maintain a lower number of cases by continuing a restrictive testing criteria the CFR will go up significantly and the disease will continue to spread rapidly. No matter what the CDC does now (short of a immediate lock down like Italy), the healthcare system is very likely to be overwhelmed."

2020-03-11T22:57:52Z,"Us smart people have known this for decades, but nobody in power was willing to give up having the pockets lined by BIG business. That&#39;s right, America&#39;s elitist, along with the U.N., corrupt politicians, and greedy business owners &amp; C.E.O.&#39;s are the ones who are responsible for the off shoring of jobs &amp; manufacturing, and the importing of illegal immigrants, weakening America economically, politically, and strategically. It&#39;s entirely their fault that &quot;We the People&quot; are in these dire straights, and it&#39;s entirely them that should be held accountable to the highest degree. that being said, I think Trumps handling of this situation has been better than satisfactory."
2020-03-11T22:56:37Z,"thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, I&#39;m Italian, living in Spain. We all need the truth"

2020-03-11T22:37:44Z,It‚Äôs the end of the world
2020-03-11T22:25:26Z,"Good job Tucker, you explained everything perfectly. Till you started going on against China. This is a global problem, and I believe,  China will help, as they&#39;re doing now, here in Italy. You must worry about the virus, not about China."
2020-03-11T22:24:17Z,Tucker.... they got to you!
2020-03-11T22:22:59Z,"It is Chinese communist party virus, not china virus. China is the slave of Chinese communist party."
2020-03-11T22:17:20Z,Summary: Don&#39;t panic but be cautious.<br>Side note: The U.S. has some a**-kissing to do.
2020-03-11T22:01:07Z,"Trump has ordered that top level meetings regarding the &quot;virus&quot; are to be classified. This stops the flow of updated information from reaching other CDC and medical personnel from information on tests, treatment and other important sources of information THAT AMERICA NEEDS TO COMBAT THIS DISEASE. TRUMP gutted the CDC BUDGET AND FIRED 70% OF THEIR WORKERS"
2020-03-11T21:59:14Z,"When will they release complete data describing the age and health of the passed.  Also, quit projecting % when you have no idea of the magnitude of the denominator."

2020-03-11T21:39:52Z,All of this just may cost Trumpstein the reelection as his lies slowly catch up to him.
2020-03-11T21:21:04Z,Probably the best speech I&#39;ve ever heard said in this pandemic period.  May God bless and keep us all these trying times.
2020-03-11T21:19:53Z,"Leftist here, and I have to say that tucker is doing real honest journalism here. Calling things objectively not sensationally or dismissively. I&#39;m impressed, keep up the good work."
2020-03-11T21:17:52Z,It good that China threatened the US.  It tips their hand and now every US citizen should recognize China as the enemy it is.   And Trump is likely to respond in a way China isn&#39;t going to like.  The US should diversify its medical supply chain and reduce their medical business to China if not eliminate it entirely.
2020-03-11T21:15:22Z,"I watch Mr. Tucker frequently and I find him valuable.  However, I am disappointed in this presentation.  Based on numerous comments below this presentation did anything but create calm.  I always keep in mind that people like Mr. Tucker use the news to promote themselves.  Their livelihood relies on repeated watching by a vast audience.  So the tendency is to hype up a topic to put themselves in the drivers seat so to speak.  Is this virus something to watch and beware of?  Yes.  Is it or any other virus such as H1N1 the end of the world?  No.  The sensible thing is to wash hands frequently, use good sanitary sense, eat right, get proper sleep and be aware of our own health.  His concerns about comments made by our government are unfair.  We live in a world driven by politics as opposed to a totalitarian regime. From what I can see our government has addressed the problem and money has been allocated to research to help deal with this.  If a government official did, indeed,  give an address like the one Mr. Tucker just did they would be hounded for days for their lack of faith in our ability to find a solution and for creating panic."
2020-03-11T21:13:32Z,"Frank Vaughan brought me here, y&#39;all should check out his videos and channel."

Mayb the enemy duznt hv the capability to pull off an EMP so they went with Plan C....or mayb this is just the warm-up to an EMP attack....do we just wait for the corresponding computer virus attacks?.....we know how the Chinese love their computer hacking<br>Question #2: Why didnt u give us some numbers for Corona patients here in the states...u made a point of comparing ours to China&#39;s but gave their numbers and Not Ours.....apples &amp; oranges Tucker?"

2020-03-11T20:51:35Z,"Yeah depending on a country that hates us because our politicians have been selling us out for decades . That&#39;s why there so disparate to remove trump.<br>All the layers of corruption are overwhelming<br>Just think of it, are tax dollars paid  politicians to sell us out while enriching themselves."

2020-03-11T20:33:44Z,I think Gaetz and Collins need to get interviewed immediately in person for the full truth about corona...go ahead thucker grow a pair we dare you.
2020-03-11T20:26:46Z,"2 days ago, Dr. Fausi said from the White House, chance were &quot;low&quot; to catch COVID-19.

2020-03-11T19:29:34Z,Everyone is calling it Trump Virus because his cuts to the CDC and his pandemic
2020-03-11T19:23:18Z,Tucker Carlson = the truth in U.S. MSM
2020-03-11T19:21:54Z,"Absolutely do not believe this disease came from the meat market. The media keeps saying this, trying to get is to believe the lie."

2020-03-11T19:10:16Z,I saw a quote were China threatens USA..I can‚Äôt find it now anyone know where it can be found?
2020-03-11T19:09:15Z,"Yes, let&#39;s not remain complacent. And what exactly can we do? Wash our hands a lot and not cough in people&#39;s faces. And what else? Well, actually...nothing, except stay home for a month. I&#39;ll wait while Tucker figures out what he wants us to specifically DO that common sense hasn&#39;t already dictated."
2020-03-11T19:03:47Z,"I work in healthcare. I appreciate Tucker&#39;s coverage of the coronavirus. It&#39;s not over the top. However, I do not care for Dr. Siegel, he&#39;s not the sharpest guy. Ingraham is downplaying this issue in a big way. She is treating people who have fear like they are stupid and then giggling like a highschool girl. She&#39;s lost me."
2020-03-11T18:50:41Z,"(:&gt;o).. Many are mocking this as if it is a joke!  I think this is going to get bad!  I believe in God and I am not afraid to die but I can&#39;t serve God, if I am dead!

2020-03-11T17:41:59Z,Break our dependence on China. Boom.
2020-03-11T17:27:28Z,"Considering how deeply this could affect our national security, and the health of our population, one has to wonder if this isn&#39;t a carefully executed biological attack, and not just some Chinaman eating some bad snake meat. After all, I am thinking the trade war is placing a heavy toll on the Chinese economy. What more effective retaliation could they have come up with? And before anyone starts Trump bashing, the Chinese were already robbing us blind, and needed to be dealt with. But I think Xi got the best of Trump, and like Sun Tsu said &quot;keep your friends close, and your enemies closer&quot;."
2020-03-11T17:26:37Z,Sad that Tucker gives into the media hype of fear.
2020-03-11T17:25:11Z,. So... there is a virus?  If this is a Chinese virus... then what about all the american ones?  And if you think there have been no diseases from America... your stupid.   I can swear.. that this virus isn‚Äôt an issue in America cause trump said so.  Don‚Äôt believe fox.  Do you? The five spend all day saying it isn‚Äôt a problem. Who do you believe.  ... oh. I don‚Äôt care. I have free healthcare and corvid test cost me just ~50 usd.   I‚Äôm just laughing how rich trump made me.
2020-03-11T17:24:09Z,I fear the virus less than I fear all the irresponsible irrational instagramers and stupid people who think there safety is everyone else‚Äôs responsibility. Those are the people who will panic loot burn and make everything 100 times worse because they never prepared so it‚Äôs everyone else‚Äôs fault.
2020-03-11T17:22:10Z,"Hey! Believe in your President, only Trump and his team do something against China.

2020-03-11T17:17:07Z,"Trump made the situation worse by down playing how infectious the virus is and it‚Äôs getting worse, we all must work together to fight the Coronavirus."
2020-03-11T17:10:00Z,Good reporting Tucker. Very good. Finaly Tucker drops the megaphone of the Trump administration.

2020-03-11T16:21:29Z,Interesting to read in a Book from 1981 by Dean Koontz called &quot;The Eyes of Darkness&quot; about a Wuhan 400 Bioweapon. And it even says that it will appear in or around 2020. Also in 2008 Sylvia Browne talks about a Coronavirus in the Book &quot;End of Days&quot;.

2020-03-11T15:55:45Z,"note the bolded CHINESE with the red boundary. This is another example of rabid nationalism trying to redirect anger towards an external enemy. Never mind the abysmal health care situation in the US, the low number of hospital beds per capita, the fact that half the adult population are either uninsured or under-insured, the lack of paid sick leave to millions of workers, all of which will greatly exacerbate the harm that this virus will do in the US. The real enemy is at home, people, and it is the profit-thirsty capitalist class that puts shareholder dividends above people&#39;s lives"

2020-03-11T15:50:22Z,"Blame the political class. They&#39;ve made it all but impossible for a regular person to start a business in this country. You&#39;ll spend 6 figures on lawyers, licensing, easements, certifications, permits and all manner of bureaucratic hoop-jumping to open even the most basic business. Then, for the privilege of being squeezed so hard, they&#39;ll squeeze you even harder with endless taxes, and one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. <br>China didn&#39;t do this to us, our gutless, craven, covetous political class did it."
2020-03-11T15:37:13Z,I hope that this virus doesn‚Äôt get so bad that we need to abandon the war in Afghanistan! Or our military aid to Ukraine

2020-03-11T15:12:23Z,The irony of Bernie losing to Biden is that Medicare For All will be the only way that the US can get control and stop this epidemic - nevermind &#39;China is not going to eat our lunch&#39; (Biden Quote) will get played 1000x in the election runup.
2020-03-11T15:12:02Z,Tucker...do you realize you are speaking the truth. Was that a mistake?
2020-03-11T15:02:19Z,"I urge all trumpers to explicitly follow the advice of trumpy on the virus. He is, after all, a very stable genius, many people are saying he has a natural ability for medicine. Just do what he says, you&#39;ll be fine."

Come on America let&#39;s get going and start taking care of ourselves . God bless America

2020-03-11T11:32:04Z,I seem to remember my President calling out this problem of outsourcing key American industries to China over 10 years ago.
2020-03-11T11:30:11Z,If it turns out the virus was made in a lab in China the threat to cut off all exports to America in the effort to slauter millions of Americans would be a declaration of war.
2020-03-11T11:26:03Z,China says &quot;their scientists&quot; have determined the virus didn&#39;t start in China.  Typical CCP revisionist history.  No doubt they will eventually blame it on the US.
2020-03-11T11:22:01Z,"Well guess what Tucker, you and the rest of Fox put that idiot into power and they are riding the whole country into the ground"
2020-03-11T11:19:21Z,"But isn&#39;t there another country who makes drugs that we can have more trust in?   Think about it, we are getting medications from China, a communist regime that sells products that are cheaply made (many do not pass the toxins test)."

2020-03-11T09:49:45Z,Why couldn‚Äôt he say Trump‚Äôs name? He was referring to Trump‚Äôs comments and his party‚Äôs wording on this issue. But not once did he say Trump... why??
2020-03-11T09:44:27Z,Good Job
2020-03-11T09:43:10Z,"I am so sad that China is doing so much harm to the people around the world.  Thanks God that  Taiwan isn&#39;t part of China.

2020-03-11T09:37:28Z,Yes more people die from the flu shot but that‚Äôs because people don‚Äôt get their flu shot every year. The problem is that there‚Äôs no vaccine for coronavirus

2020-03-11T06:07:12Z,People in China are offended that Tucker called it the &quot;Chinese CoronaVirus&quot; inferring that it&#39;s racist. <br>Last time I checked this virus wouldn&#39;t have happened on this large of a scale if China dealt with it sooner.
2020-03-11T09:41:35Z,"America has had 2 months to prepare for it and has done nothing. Trump gutted the CDC, you can&#39;t keep blaming China for your own actions and inactions."

People that get the virus, and aren‚Äôt sick enough to go to the hospital and get tested, do not get counted as people that got the virus and survived. So the mortality rate is no where near 3.4%. It is way lower‚Äîprobably about the same as the flu, but there is not enough data yet to know exactly what it is."
2020-03-11T05:52:35Z,If China embargoes medical supplies it will be war I would guess. Let&#39;s hope they don&#39;t do that.

2020-03-11T05:38:57Z,Can you please tell the President this and tell him to communicate it accurately. His words have consequences and because he misrepresented the severity of this virus  MILLIONS OF PEOPLE are not taking this virus seriously.
2020-03-11T05:38:47Z,This is all a cover for the worldwide mass arrests.  Have your flags ready to wave at the soldiers when they come rolling through your neighborhoods.

Prep for a 3 month  quarantine as NYC called in the Military and that‚Äôs going to be Country wide with States being  quarantined  So that means no goods refilling the stores. You have nothing to lose by prepping and everything to gain. Also prices will skyrocket soon with the tanking economy and lack of travel!!! Just my two cents for you. Take care n stay safe n strong.

I live in China and yes life has changed, no University/schools are open, restaurants, bars, hair dressers are all shut. However, there is no panic or rioting and we have had no new cases outside of Wuhan for at least 4 days. I worry about the UK (I am British), people will do nothing, then suddenly panic and perhaps riot then out will come the troops on the streets. I assume the US will be similar. This virus is highly contagious more than 4.5 metres separation is needed and it stays in the air for 30 minutes. The Chinese are not gloating they have taken a big financial hit. China doesn&#39;t have enough medical supplies for itself. China doesn&#39;t hate the US, Tucker is over reacting to say that."

For once I am really relieved that our government runs and/or controls healthcare, basically every school, college, university, healthcare center, water and energy system and public transportation. They can react immediately without first negotiating with coorporations. It  is possible to run more buses and trains, do home office, implement safety rules in institutions of education. A lot of public employees are currently transferred to face the crisis."

2020-03-10T22:49:07Z,I‚Äôm disappointed that Tucker seems to be doing a little fear mongering here. Yes the corona virus is real and serious but don‚Äôt exaggerate and feed fear and be honest about it. I‚Äôve heard lower numbers than what he gives here.

2020-03-10T18:02:06Z,"In the late 80&#39;s/ early 90&#39;s America took the decision to sacrifice parts of it&#39;s own economy and, let&#39;s be frank, it&#39;s own American citizens to make China richer and &quot;bring China in from the cold&quot;. America thought that if Chinese people became richer they would democratise and liberalise etc and the Chinese Communist party would fall. American manufacturing and jobs were shipped to China en masse and Americans thrown on the scrap heap. What a massive fail, a total disaster that has been. America is now so dependent on China that you import drugs and drug components, that your lives depend on. &quot;Globalism&quot; and &quot;Free Trade&quot; is a danger and is basically the transfer of wealth and jobs from the working/middle class in developed countries to others in poorer countries. Both Democrats and Republicans have done this, in fact Republican ideology is wedded to this &quot;Free Trade&quot; and profit for business at all costs. Many thought Trump would change that, but he&#39;s done NOTHING, a total failure. Bernie is our only hope, Biden is another idiot deeply responsible."

People are getting this, because of the incompetence of it&#39;s leader/leaders and their lies and half truths. How many more people have to be infected and die, before these idiots at fake faux news and other right wing media, take it as fact and not some ploy by the democrats? Bill Gates has told everyone in Seattle he will provide free coronavirus test kits (millions) to anyone who wants them and yet our government, can&#39;t test but a couple thousand people in weeks and they still don&#39;t know how many that is.

Wuhan, Hubei and China did their best, not without some fault, to contain this and did buy some time for the rest of the world to prepare for this problem. Almost all the current 500+ cases in the U.S. occurred long after Chinese nationals stopped entering the U.S. since 1/25/2020. So almost all of these current cases were sourced from elsewhere in the U.S. or other places (again the point is the virus will defy man-made national borders and borders between states, cities and regions). In particular, a lot of these cases could have been prevented if test kits had been available earlier to detect and keep virus carriers from non-virus carriers. Life Care employees, where many deaths occurred, did not even get fully screened at least until most recently. Should the employees who are taking care of seniors be tested sooner rather than later? The U.S. and other countries including China should join hands to fight this disease rather than emotionally bitching one another and stirring up nationalist feelings in the face of this global public health problem."

2020-03-12T23:15:54Z,except for the extreme cuts to the cdc that Trump made which harmed the ability to test of course.
2020-03-13T12:38:04Z,"feelings Are Not Arguments the CDC cut 80% of its budget in 2018 in regards to fighting a global virus outbreak, reach of activity was limited from 49 countries to 10 countries. When in 2018 the national health security council, as a part of the national security council, warned that the nation was not prepared for a global pandemic, the administration acted swiftly and decisivly by shutting down the health security council. This was a part of the rollback of 15 billions on funding for public health that the administration executed in the executive branch."
2020-03-14T12:11:18Z,"‚Äãfeelings Are Not Arguments. It is a fact that the Trump administration tried to reduce funding to infrastructure to fight a global pandemic wherever possible. CDC programs to monitor and prevent the outbreak of global pandemics were cut by 80%. The national health security council as part of the national security council was shut down, after it warned of a dramatic unpreparedness for a global pandemic outbreak in 2018. Because of these failings Trump was purposefully false about  the Virus&#39; containment and purposefully false about the availabilty of tests. The United Stated have made 23 tests for every million of residents up to March 11, while health officials in the Netherlands conducted 350 test per million of residents, Italy tested 826 per million inhabitants, while south corea tested 3600 inhabitants per million. Also, the Chinese province Guangdong in south China has tested 2800 for every million. The Trump administration has no hint of knowing how high the number of exponentially growing cases actually is. It is very likely that the low number of COVID-19 cases compared to the EU is due to the lack of testing, not a lesser rate of infection. Blaming foreigners, who have as of now mounted a much better campaign at monitoring and containing the Virus is a distraction for failing to respond to warnings from the the national health council in 2018. Instead we could see a pattern of disinvestment and downplaying threats until, as the state of now, that was no longer possible."
2020-03-26T02:03:11Z,"Funding would make little to no difference. China did not allow CDC personnell on the ground in December. They played it like nothing big was happening. The doctors in China that were sounding alarm about virus transmitting from human to human were silenced by the communist party. First evidence of human to human transmittion was detected in mid December.  World Health Organization dispatched team in January with 3 americans on it; that was first time americans were cued in on situation. By the time Trump shut borders, there were thousands of people that traveled to and from China to US. He got labeled racist and biggot by Biden but thatnks goodness he closed borders when he did. Why do you think even WHO did not say anything about virus until Italy literally began to die off"

Under eighty years of age, more are dying from the &quot;common flu&quot; than they are of this &quot;novel virus.&quot;  Tucker had an agenda in this piece.  It was at the end (about China).  Everything before the end (about the virus) was geared toward making that point.  He didn&#39;t include the facts about the virus - like those I just mentioned - that would calm fears.  He only used the ones that hyped it, as these were more convenient to his ultimate point in this presentation.  The effect of this is broader than the goal he hopes to achieve.  Specifically, it drives down business.  It drives down the economy.  People don&#39;t go out because they&#39;re scared.  They&#39;re being told not to go out.  They&#39;re being told they should be scared.  That&#39;s costly to business.  To the economy.  Tucker might not be participating in this fearmongering in exactly the same way as the rest of the media - he&#39;s trying to make a larger, more important, point - but in making that point, he is generating unnecessary fear, given the full scope of the data.  That&#39;s irresponsible.  And by leaving out the more calming aspects of the data, it&#39;s tantamount to falsehood.  Irresponsible and false.

I am doing what I usually do to keep my immunity as optimal as possible, not depending on false hope from the development of a vaccine.  I also watch minimal media coverage of the virus because it angers me more than scares me.  I choose to not fall victim to panic, and I appreciate my leaders doing the same."

TRUMP IS NOT ONE OF THE BOYS. THEY CAN NOT CONTROL HEM AND TELL HIM WHAT TO DO. this New World Order is working very very very hard to break down America and it&#39;s People so they can control them. they want a one world leader to control all it&#39;s People of the world. the only way to stop this is to VOTE. voting is the only way to stop this Insane madness. if we lose the CONSTITUTION WE LOSE IT ALL. and we will NEVER and i mean NEVER get it back."
2020-03-10T15:09:44Z,"While I agree with Tucker‚Äôs assessment about the epidemic, I‚Äôm not sure why he thinks the PRESIDENT‚ÄôS downplaying of the severity is on par to some fringe left people not calling this the ‚ÄúChinese Coronavirus‚Äù. I get that he has to demonize the other side so that he can rightly criticize Trump for possibly making this worse."
2020-03-10T15:08:56Z,Well Trump warned you all in 2016 China China China the left should be punished traitors.

2020-03-10T15:05:57Z,"Fact check Tucker.  The flu has an average mortality rate of approximately 8.5%.  It affects the elderly and those with compromised immune systems primarily with secondary infections such as pneumonia.  From the evidence so far available, COVID-19 has a mortality rate of approximately 3.5%.  That may go higher as we gain experience, but it does NOT appear to be any worse than a flu epidemic.  The panic and hysteria surrounding COVID-19 is appalling!"
2020-03-10T18:22:39Z,That‚Äôs not true
2020-03-10T15:05:39Z,Uh oh. Guess we&#39;ll have to add tucker to the list of &quot;deep state&quot; operatives if he&#39;s gonna criticize the supreme leader. <br>He can join the other 2.4 billion people that must also be part of the &quot;deep state&quot;.

They also inject antibiotics into animals<br>so that when humans eat meat or drink milk or eat products made from milk like Cheese, <br>humans build up a resistance to antibiotics.  <br>Also, in dairy milk products are mega female hormones.

2020-03-12T21:34:54Z,@@garlandpomeroy8060 So the thousands of studies on nutrients interacting with specific components of the immune system are all fake?
2020-03-10T14:59:01Z,Tucker is the best. He&#39;s one of the  few people that doesn&#39;t spin stuff into something fake
2020-03-10T14:58:15Z,Exactly. Stock up and pray!

2020-03-10T14:50:39Z,Dam Tucker I feel like I&#39;m dying now listening to you.
2020-03-10T14:47:57Z,It&#39;s going to be the disease of the century
2020-03-10T14:46:14Z,Thank you Tucker Carlson for being the ONLY adult in the room.
2020-03-11T11:37:12Z,So you aren&#39;t an adult?
2020-03-10T14:45:26Z,Finally!  Tucker Carson stands up against the Liar in Chief!
2020-03-10T14:42:24Z,Is this being SPREAD VIA CHEMTRAIL PLANES on purpose???
2020-03-10T14:40:58Z,Is it possible the Chinese could have maliciously started this virus and if so what would be the reason ? Could it be the trades deals that they don&#39;t particularly like ? How would it effect their country in relation to how it would effect our country ? Would it make their economy better or worst ? Would it make our economy better or worst ? Obviously they don&#39;t want Trump as president so would this shakeup things during reelection time ?
2020-03-10T14:40:08Z,Who does China think they are? Its our govt fault we are in this situation!
2020-03-10T14:38:27Z,LOL look at Fox trying to spill this into a Chinese thing? Nice attempt to hide from the facts that it is now an American Problem and the data doesn&#39;t lie as much as Trump may try!
2020-03-10T14:31:04Z,This is why we need to bring manufacturing back to the USA. One country should never be allowed to bring down the global economy.
2020-03-10T14:29:58Z,"I find it odd that you keep calling it the &quot;Chinese Coronavirus&quot;...I like you, but that line sounds like a line a propagandist would say. Besides this point...How come you&#39;re not bringing up the fact that 40 days after the virus showed up in the US, only 600 or so people have been tested across the whole country? Why is the country not outraged by this???"
2020-03-10T16:29:20Z,"@@swapnilupadhyay5976 the Spanish Flu didn&#39;t originate in Spain. It has been called such, mostly due to propaganda (similar to this video).<br><br>When someone is saying &quot;the Chinese Coronavirus&quot; on repeat this is propaganda.<br><br>When that same person isn&#39;t bringing up the fact that the US has done practically the least testing on its population for the past 40 days, and isn&#39;t sounding alarm bells since you could be sitting next to someone with Coronavirus, and instead they want to bash in your head &quot;China, China, China&quot; while not mentioning the complete lack of doing ANYTHING useful to protect Americans, that too is propaganda.<br><br>The best country in the world can&#39;t even test it&#39;s population right? Really? It&#39;s an embarrassment.<br><br>Keep up drinking the cool-aid though bro"
2020-03-10T14:29:43Z,Great job Tucker
2020-03-10T14:29:28Z,Tucker to me had the best idea of what we should do in regards to the coronavirus. We should have all ties with the Chinese stop flights stop as well.
2020-03-10T14:29:16Z,"Mortality rate, as a concept,  is meaningful or useful only when contamination is contained. If that is not the case, talking about it is pretty much misleading!"
2020-03-10T14:26:19Z,"Btw, Tucker is spot on once again."
2020-03-10T14:26:08Z,Time to wake up from this nightmare!
2020-03-10T14:26:06Z,but your great leader said that all is well and you shouldn&#39;t worry. F**KING IDIOTS
2020-03-10T14:25:34Z,Man I never thought I&#39;d ever be praising Tucker Carlson for anything. THANK YOU for this segment. I hope it causes some people to open their eyes.

2020-03-10T14:11:53Z,"I hope President Trump was watching Tucker last night to see this.  The president has been spot on about reducing our reliance on foreign manufacturing and this proves the point.  However, he is mishandling the current situation by downplaying the risk of the virus rather than taking early decisive action to slow the spread."
2020-03-10T14:11:03Z,Big pharmaceutical and medical companies CANNOT sell in America unless manufactured in America. NO EXCEPTIONS.

2020-03-10T14:07:46Z,This is A  CNN crisis virus.....Fake news.......
2020-03-10T14:07:26Z,If I understood you correctly you said if 1000 people had the virus and are under 80 years old and I know this is horrible 34 of them could die or 3% the War on Drugs that America continues to operate kills a lot more than that. However mr. Trump I hope he stays healthy as stated that we will find a way to beat this as we beat everything. Horrible as it all is travels really great right now has the streets are empty. We&#39;re all going to die someday of something that&#39;s the way of life thanks Tucker for keeping it real

2020-03-10T13:57:52Z,I dont believe Tucket Carlsons words...i dont recieve his micro lecture of inevitable curse and mayhem as if he is an all knowing expert and futuristic prophet. He is spreading fear and panic so snuggly...I am appalled! Do not recieve his words!

The who, CDC, federal government,  local government,  state, and local have not done anything in the United States close to a semi reasonable response for containing anything. Now let&#39;s skip this step and mitigate. Are you kidding me. The world will be in quarantine while the us is telling us to not wear a mask in public and wash your hands. It seems like the plan now is let nature take its course, business as usual. I have never been more disgusted. And as par as the politics, that this is a hoax  to sway voters. I&#39;m sure Italy would wreck there own country to effect our votes..."

It looks like the  infection in the US is going to be something like a logistics growth curve.  I wished those at Fox News would take this more serious."

2020-03-10T13:35:54Z,Also it was the president who said that he thinks the mortality rate is lower than 0.1 % and the other numbers were wrong...
2020-03-10T13:35:03Z,Tucker thank you for an honest and great message and I really appreciate your reporting!
2020-03-10T13:34:20Z,Globalization in free fall.
2020-03-10T13:33:44Z,"Dear tucker, although i sometime enjoy your program, it is not democrats that are making it worse, it has been the president constant denial of the virus and its effect in the US that has created a lot of confusion in the people... the head of th country is the President and it is his responsibility to be honest about what is going on... this is not on democrats or party politics, this is on the president and his lack of responsibility on honest information on the matter."
2020-03-10T18:31:46Z,Swapnil Upadhyay he actually sad that. You can find the clips for yourself. He is also lying about the seriousness of it. That‚Äôs what Tucker said. Denying that is just useless at this point.
2020-03-10T13:33:23Z,"Your leaders, all of our leaders are all part of this global conspiracy. They are not there to either serve or protect you but instead the interests of a hostile elite that seek absolute power and control. <br>To think anything other is absolute folly. <br>The sad thing is so many Americans are willingly self blinkered with earmuffs in place walking with abject complacency towards the precipice."

Here we are with everything from education to ability, but the greed has sent this control overseas; bring manufacturing back here!  But if they want to hold drugs......we hold food.

Italy also is part of the EU, a corrupt globalist state that has encouraged its members to embrace people from third world countries in AFRICA and the Middle East.  These people bring with them a culture of terrible personal hygiene, disgusting eating and defecating habits and general poor health.  Italy has long been on the FRONT line of this invasion.  Also, they are on the same continent as the source of this disease, rather than an ocean away.  Comparing us to Italy is a poor analogy.  Italy has never been known for its cutting edge medical systems or its top of the line doctors.  Tucker you do all Americans a disservice by even making this comparison.  America is UNIQUE in the world.  Not sure why that fact is so hard for ALL the media to grasp!!!"

2020-03-10T12:55:47Z,"Until our government stops serving greed as its #1 goal and weakness, WE the People will be subject to effects we didn&#39;t vote for. The dilution of our sovereignty and status is nothing new. Greed combined with so called progressive thinking has always been our Achilles heel. Our Constitution was designed to express the best system the world had ever seen. Freedom was at its core. And there is the conundrum. Freedom is misinterpreted and distorted by government and too many of We the People. That collective allows greed and unbridled passions to guide its thinking. Look no further than this to understand how we arrived at all the negatives we bear as a nation. Chinese Corona Virus is a wake up call. Understand that or stay woke and greedy."

2020-03-10T12:51:22Z,"So is the common cold an epidemic.  I am surprised that Fox News has turned into trailing the left fear mongers. I guess there is no saving the media.  It&#39;s an infectious disease.  WE KNOW NOTHING THAT IS NOT TAINTED THROUGH HEARSAY, OPINION AND GOSSIP.   This is the surest way to prove the spirituality in this country is at an all time low &amp; there is no other country to move to that Christianity is stronger in devoted practice.  Sad it is, and Fox now has been overwhelmed and become Cancerous &amp; sadly it is worse than the dreaded virus because it doesn&#39;t have to be touched: only heard and seen.  It&#39;s done instantly by the 10&#39;s of millions daily and no vaccine for a cure has been found, nor is there one being researched. It&#39;s an emotional, mental, intellectual, physical and spiritual infection that respects nothing nor anyone.  In all things that it is, it surely finds Love an abomination.  Without love, there can be no happiness.  Fox now is headed for the history books, bacause it once vehemently fought against that which it now finds itself actively seeking &amp; promoting.  The graveyard of Ex great Clarion callers.  As Trump said, it&#39;s momentum that is most important. That is where the strength is shown &amp; Fox News had a lot, but sadly, not near enough. Everything and everyone tires and weakens at some point: Fox has reached their breaking point. But it was a good run, but it&#39;s over and now they will swing the other way, to the same degree. That&#39;s just how it works.  Find where you belong and move there, for the fight never stops and no one ever really wins, except the unhappiness, SADDNESS, pained are perpetuated in perpituety.  Enjoy the pain for you have earned, then move beyond the pain and learn the lesson or the lesson comes again and again until the lesson has been learned.  So the only way to win, is Not to Play !! No player will go unscathed, sad that Fox went that way."

2020-03-10T12:37:52Z,Sorry Tucker your wrong. It is just as bad as the flu. Your just using documented cases to create your stats. You said in the beginning that there were more cases that we did not know about. Meaning the percent is actually lower than 3 percent.
2020-03-10T12:37:21Z,This disease is not a persons fault. That‚Äôs ridiculous. It‚Äôs an entire country‚Äôs
2020-03-10T12:36:55Z,Sure sounds like biological warfare to me.

AND as this is a new disease, there are reports from Chinese doctors that patients who recover can be reinfected where the virus then attacks the heart causing heart attacks. The pride and arrogance of the baby boomers will be lead to their early deaths unlike their parent&#39;s generation."

2020-03-10T12:00:41Z,"Don&#39;t forget China owns a great deal of our debt too. Why on earth did these politicians think letting a hostile communist regime control multiple aspects of our economy was a good thing? If we wanted cheap goods we could buy them from Thailand or Mexico, so why China? Doesn&#39;t make sense. Trump had the right idea with the tariffs, although we should have been looking for/creating new companies not in China to import from or even create new jobs right here in America. I honestly believe Americans are willing to spend a few extra bucks at the store so we don&#39;t have these types of problems and they will hopefully be creating jobs right here in America."
2020-03-10T12:00:00Z,"It&#39;s only affecting our lives because they are using it to tank the economy and Sorry but people are stupid for falling for the hype. That includes everyone in the media and I include the ones I most trust to tell the truth. I include Tucker and Bongino in this category. It is contradictory to say to stay calm and then go into all the overblown information out there that needs to be debunked. In this case, they are just as guilty of parsing language as the MSM. They want to tell everyone to be calm but they themselves are not calm."
2020-03-10T11:55:37Z,"All this is the true face of globalism. The virus appears at the other part of the world with the economic and health consequences for the whole world. Trump must go back to 2015 with Build a Wall, Bring Back to USA Production and Soldiers, Attack on the Elites ... because if he relies only on the economy he will lose the election."
2020-03-10T11:55:05Z,I am not a TC fan but he is getting closer to reality then expected. Look at the interactive map from Johns Hopkins. What other virus has spread so quickly and widely in three months? How in an age of globalism are some countries relatively untouched?

2020-03-10T11:46:26Z,Mr Carlson thank you for putting partisan politics where it belongs in the trash. POTUS needs to stop the name calling of fellow Americans and be a strong leader and reach across the aisle and put Americans health first. Dems and Reps need to work together and not attack each other. There were stupid mistakes made early on own them and quit the name calling because we are all Americans. I&#39;m 54yrs old and have never heard a POTUS call fellow Americans names. A strong POTUS unites the country not divides it. It is not the time to be hateful it&#39;s time to be helpful smart leaders should know that

2020-03-12T15:45:45Z,Because everyone else on Fox their main goal is to make Trump look good no matter what which means don‚Äôt tell the truth about the virus because it could hurt the stock market or people will blame trump.Tucker has always been a freethinker ever since he was on crossfire back in the day

2020-03-10T11:24:51Z,"China doesn&#39;t hold all the cards, China is very dependant on other countries for food, oil and and minerals. Also chinas water is very contaminated so they import huge amounts of it. The threat is mutual on both sides. Food is chinas biggest worry. Nothing will cause social unrest in China more than food shortages. I expect we will get our medical supplies and medicine but at much higher prices we have paid in the past."

2020-03-10T11:22:13Z,"Social and Corona Contagion:   In 1374, in Aachen, Germany, throngs of people started dancing - dancing until some of them collapsed from exhaustion. Legend says that this strange behaviour spread as far away as Madagascar. Other similar occasions of mob behaviour have been recorded. Closer to home, if you start yawning then a person near to you may feel the impulse to yawn; if you start itching yourself nearby someone may also feel inclined to itch. What these behaviours may have in common is referred to as ‚Äúsocial contagion‚Äù (or ‚Äúcollective hysterical disorder‚Äù). Your behaviour could have a mirrored and social effect. Currently, concerned about corona virus, if you wash your hands and demonstrate safe behaviours then you are likely to influence, or ‚Äúnudge‚Äù other people towards safe behaviours. However, if you demonstrate unsafe behaviours, and worse, you directly encourage other people, then we can have irrational situations such as people dancing on down to shops and loading-up on toilet paper. The link between toilet paper and protecting yourself or the economy, from corona virus consequences, is about as strong as damp and perforated single ply. Sometimes people wonder about ‚Äòmob-rule‚Äô and other such behaviours, we‚Äôd like to think that it couldn‚Äôt be us. How many rolls did you buy when last shopping?"

2020-03-10T10:31:12Z,"For weeks now I&#39;ve been considering whether the outbreak of the Wuhan virus was in fact a deliberate act of revenge by the Chinese against Donald Trump for winning the trade war and bringing the Chinese to heel through the use of economic tariffs. Honor or &quot;face&quot; and shame are still very prevalent in China, particularly among the older generations and the loss of face demands a response. The timing and the epicenter of the outbreak was far too convenient to be entirely coincidental. However, I do think that the specific time and place of the release was accidental and I&#39;ve come to believe they may have had a different idea in mind. Think about it... at that time China was full of ex-pats home for Chinese New Year, millions of people who would make perfect hosts for the virus with many working in service industries and catering in the west, coming into contact with hundreds of people every day.<br>That said, I do think China has miscalculated, massively.<br>While this virus may damage the west economically and perhaps politically too -  in the short term - it will also force Governments to reassess their long-term relationships with the Chinese and bring a great deal of processing and manufacturing home, particularly of chemicals, pre-cursors and certain sensitive and dual-use electronic products. This will further damage the Chinese economy and close off entire export industry sectors to them for generations to come.

2020-03-10T09:53:27Z,God bless you üôè‚ù£Ô∏è thanks for being non partisan about public health
2020-03-10T12:30:59Z,"For what do you bless? No he is wrong. He is also racist.<br><br>1. The Shocking truth is that We need to SALUTE THE NATION OF CHINA !!!!  Why? <br><br><br>The virus is from &quot;China&quot; but it is not a &quot;Chinese virus&quot;. Mother nature creates virus using evolution [which itself is blind].  It could have happened anywhere on earth. There is no &quot;blaming&quot; China - as far as America is concerned.<br><br>In fact we need to praise China for &quot;sharing all the information, inviting W.H.O and Americans&quot; as soon as they were able to do that - DESPITE officially being communist and a &quot;Closed nation when it comes to information&quot; . They did us a HUGE favor by being ahead of things and on top of their game.  They went against their own internal historic policy of secrecy for us, for Uncle Sam. We salute all of the Chinese government as Americans.<br><br>As Chinese citizens they can legit be mad at their government for initial secrecy. That&#39;s none of our business.<br><br>As for Tucker: he is directly racist against the Chinese. He is knowingly racist.<br><br>2.  Globalism is bad? Someone said that! I replied:<br><br>You are correct. But &quot;how so&quot; ? <br><br>Capitalism is embedded in a democracy. So the law must always apply against fraud or force. Further, the governments job is to make certain vital products to national interests must NEVER be from any &quot;one&quot; source or nation [e.g. China]. <br><br>How are you wrong? You assume that government can interfere in economic affairs. It can not and must not - because to do so is &quot;Anti capitalism&quot; meaning it is socialism (regardless of the name of the party as Republican or other).<br><br>Upon MY premises the U.S.A was formed, found and lived from 1776 to 1916 when there was interference by government into economics starting with taxation upon the very rich. Eventually with each generation, once there&#39;s a tear , they kept on tearing the sheet until you pay for this daily even reading THIS post - you pay tax on utilities (e.g. to charge your phone or charged).<br><br>In summary and to repeat: Globalism IS capitalism. But Globalism does NOT mean one has to RELY on emergency and vital items from any ONE source. In fact it is GLOBALISM that will enable us to have RESILIENCE by having MANY MORE sources - not just &quot;America&quot;, nor just &quot;China&quot; to <b>supply</b> and/or * make the products*** and make them far cheaper just like China does AND THEREFORE we the U.S.A benefit.  ALWAYS SUPPORT LIBERTY: this means capitalism. That means globalism."
2020-03-10T09:50:55Z,"Tucker really needs to get his facts straight. He states the &quot;mortality rate&quot; as being 3.4%, however, that number is inflated because it doesn&#39;t take into consideration of those who DON&#39;T go to an emergency room, private doctor or urgent care even though they are infected by the virus. MANY treat this like the flu and YES like the flu, in most, it passes. So, if you got the sniffles and a cough...you may think it&#39;s the cold and simply stay home and rest...but in fact it was the virus. While other experience a fever and sore throat and decide to take over the counter meds to self treat. It&#39;s only those who don&#39;t respond to rest and time that eventually go to the doctors and only THEN is it determined they in fact have the virus.  After factoring in the likelihood of those who don&#39;t seek medical care and recover on their own the percentage is closer to 1%.  And as far as the &quot;regular&quot; flu goes...strange he didn&#39;t mention the number of people who die from it. In the US ALONE , depending on the year, anywhere between 12,000 and 60,000 people die from complications to the flu.  Worldwide the flu kills  anywhere from 291,000 to 646,000 each year. <br><br><br> And how many people has this virus killed so far?"
2020-03-10T16:55:42Z,You dont know much about this.
2020-03-11T05:14:00Z,"A. if what you are saying is true, then that means there are many, many more cases than have been reported...I don&#39;t see how that makes the situation better.<br>B. if anything the mortality rate is UNDER-reported because it only includes people who have already died; there are a lot of people who are currently infected who will eventually succumb to the disease (or complications resulting from it).  There are currently a total of over 4200 deaths with about 66000 recoveries...that gives us a mortality rating of just over 6%.  And this thing is spreading really, really fast."

2020-03-10T17:05:17Z,"Been doing that for over a decade now.  Despite being &quot;English&quot;, I farm with horses and also take them out on the road as the Amish do.  When fracking falls apart, I&#39;m ready.  In fact, we have Amish friends who want to see how we&#39;re doing things because we still use practices many of them left behind in an attempt to compete against the fossil fueled economy."
2020-03-10T20:02:54Z,Thats an easy one.<br>The amish live in small groups and are sulf sustaining because of their size.<br><br><br><br>You cant feed massive cities of MILLIONS without industrial scale farming.<br><br><br>If we ceased to use fossil fuel along with the machines we use to farm the world COULD quickly find itself starving.
2020-03-10T20:04:04Z,I said that you cant feed MILLIONS of people in mega cities without industrial farming methods.
2020-03-10T22:51:48Z,"@@mattlich88 -- True, but over the long run, we won&#39;t be able to feed our inflated population using industrial methods either.  60% of US oil production (fracking) has never made a single penny according to the IEA, and at the current oil price I&#39;d doubt <b>any</b> US oil producers are in the black.  How much longer do you think that can continue?  No matter how you slice it, nearly everyone will be a farmer once fossil fuels are no longer available, just as we were before the fossil fueled/industrial era.   Best to figure it out while we still have the luxury of time!"
2020-03-10T23:38:10Z,Because they are mini totalitarian communes. No thanks.
2020-03-10T07:48:00Z,its a pandemic...
2020-03-10T07:44:47Z,Why add ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù to the coronavirus name? This news organisation should be ashamed.
2020-03-10T07:44:22Z,It sounds like the Chinese just declared war.
2020-03-10T07:43:07Z,Chinese probably did this to hurt their greatest foe and prevent the reelection of President Donald Trump.<br><br>Trump is the first President to stand up against the PRC&#39;s relentless aggression.

2020-03-10T11:07:10Z,Yeah but it was only a spread test with a weaker strain. They have the real deadly version ready to go in case of war.
2020-03-10T07:37:17Z,They are using simple colloidal silver vaporizer mists in Chinese hospitals. US pharma and docs will ignore that fact and go for a vaccine etc. No &quot;scare&quot; profit in something people can make easily at home.

2020-03-10T07:35:29Z,"Most straightforward message I‚Äôve heard in weeks, and it speaks the true!! There only one point it is false accused which is &quot;Chinese people don&#39;t hate American!! But the Chinese Communist Party hated all Democratic countries!!! Cuz Communist country are dictatorships country, there is no true freedom in any form of Communist country, I am Chinese and I know so well!&quot;&quot;"
2020-03-10T12:30:39Z,"Not straight forward. Reasoning: No he is wrong. He is also racist.<br><br>1. The Shocking truth is that We need to SALUTE THE NATION OF CHINA !!!!  Why? <br><br><br>The virus is from &quot;China&quot; but it is not a &quot;Chinese virus&quot;. Mother nature creates virus using evolution [which itself is blind].  It could have happened anywhere on earth. There is no &quot;blaming&quot; China - as far as America is concerned.<br><br>In fact we need to praise China for &quot;sharing all the information, inviting W.H.O and Americans&quot; as soon as they were able to do that - DESPITE officially being communist and a &quot;Closed nation when it comes to information&quot; . They did us a HUGE favor by being ahead of things and on top of their game.  They went against their own internal historic policy of secrecy for us, for Uncle Sam. We salute all of the Chinese government as Americans.<br><br>As Chinese citizens they can legit be mad at their government for initial secrecy. That&#39;s none of our business.<br><br>As for Tucker: he is directly racist against the Chinese. He is knowingly racist.<br><br>2.  Globalism is bad? Someone said that! I replied:<br><br>You are correct. But &quot;how so&quot; ? <br><br>Capitalism is embedded in a democracy. So the law must always apply against fraud or force. Further, the governments job is to make certain vital products to national interests must NEVER be from any &quot;one&quot; source or nation [e.g. China]. <br><br>How are you wrong? You assume that government can interfere in economic affairs. It can not and must not - because to do so is &quot;Anti capitalism&quot; meaning it is socialism (regardless of the name of the party as Republican or other).<br><br>Upon MY premises the U.S.A was formed, found and lived from 1776 to 1916 when there was interference by government into economics starting with taxation upon the very rich. Eventually with each generation, once there&#39;s a tear , they kept on tearing the sheet until you pay for this daily even reading THIS post - you pay tax on utilities (e.g. to charge your phone or charged).<br><br>In summary and to repeat: Globalism IS capitalism. But Globalism does NOT mean one has to RELY on emergency and vital items from any ONE source. In fact it is GLOBALISM that will enable us to have RESILIENCE by having MANY MORE sources - not just &quot;America&quot;, nor just &quot;China&quot; to <b>supply</b> and/or * make the products*** and make them far cheaper just like China does AND THEREFORE we the U.S.A benefit.

Gotta take those political-colored glasses off now and then Rush. I hope he doesn&#39;t end up getting some of his fans killed. One of my friends is a fan of his and she reduced her concern about Covid19 after he started gaslighting about it."

Instead of the lies to cover up for this inadequate and incompetent president who wants to paint a rosy picture like everything is fine and there&#39;s nothing to worry about. He changes the narrative and lies to the American people every time he has a press conference or tweet. It has been a long time coming but the blind eyes are finally beginning to open now. This virus doesn&#39;t care about politics, party affiliation; whether you&#39;re rich, poor, in between and etc... We need a leader who is open and honest and knows how to LEAD and protect us. Who is concern about people&#39;s lives, not concern about numbers and how this is going to affect his chances of reelection. He was playing the fiddle or tweeting a bunch of nonsense while Rome was burning. He should have started preparing for this virus outbreak way back in late December and early January when this first started. No, he wants to play around on twitter instead of being on the JOB. Now Rome is burning! And this is affecting everybody, republicans, democrats, and independents like myself. Thanks for being asleep at the wheel trump and causing the situation to be far worse and greater than it needed to be had you prepared in advance. And I hope he gets out of the way and let the experts handle things. As it is too little and too late for him to play catch up...way behind the 8 ball here..."

2020-03-10T06:17:22Z,This is why Trump was right. He said we shouldn‚Äôt be relying on other countries we should be self sistine. I agree. Look we‚Äôre we are now.
2020-03-11T01:58:35Z,If only Trump were in a position to do something about America&#39;s foreign policy.
2020-03-10T06:11:17Z,"I said repeatedly over the past few decades, if China, a communist country,  ever got their lip down with the West and decided to close their borders, it would ignite a world wide recession.  Needless to say, most people thought I was crazy, but the fact is, that China is and always has been a sleeping giant.  Politicians, govts and big corp from the West have put China into a position of control and power because they wanted to make more money and used China and her cheap labor source to do so.   China for some countries, is their largest importer and for many countries, we are theirs.   In effect though, they have us by the short and curlies....they know it and we are being made to realise just how serious and in control they can be if they want to be.   The biggest mistake made decades ago (worldwide) was closing down local businesses and importing almost everything from a Communist country, which is... a sleeping giant."

2020-03-10T06:10:44Z,"If Trump explains that when more testing is done, more mild cases of corona 19 will be discovered so total cases will go up, he will be called callus and unfeeling and the left will claim the increase is due to his inaction.  When he imposed a limited travel ban in january to end direct flights from china the left called him racist; now they say he didn&#39;t do enough.  When Trump accurately and correctly pointed out that healthy individuals had little to feat from corona he was called unfeeling toward the aged.  The left is dividing this country on every faultline.  The behavior of the left and Democrats is outright treasonous."

2020-03-10T05:18:26Z,China just officially declared the end of &quot;Corona Virus&quot; claiming the origin of the virus may have not come from China. Now the virus just started to spread through out the 30 states. We don&#39;t have enough masks and affordable testing kits. What do we do?
2020-03-10T05:17:16Z,"Who to believe? Tucker or our govt. Even Cuomo, deblasio are saying the same thing as Trump that it will not get as bad as Italy. Here Tucker Carlson has us believing it will reach millions"
2020-03-11T01:53:32Z,Well... De Blasio just sent The National Guard to lock down Westchester/ New Rochelle. So I doubt he&#39;s in that group you mentioned.
2020-03-10T05:16:30Z,"Thank you for saying the truth on this virus,  I believe you probably saved lives tonight by waking them up.  On a side note that Dr. You had is a joke, last two weeks he&#39;s been playing it down on Fox Business.   He should apologize for his previous behavior.   I will remember him for being part of the problems."
2020-03-10T05:16:22Z,"US fought 2 wars with China in Vietnam and the North Korea. Technically US is still at war with NoKo, which means US is still at war with China, yet China is probably the largest trading partner of the US. How does that make sense?<br><br>You allow your sensitive businesses to operate there and they steal your technology, then you cry. You allow China students in your top universities, they learn and enrich the enemy, then you cry. Why blame China for your own stupidity? They will do what is necessary to prosper themselves. <br><br>But even now people like Tim Cook continue to suck on mother China&#39;s breast and won&#39;t let go. Are the people in the US so lame that they cannot do what the factories in China can? Ford is turning in his grave."

Too many people do that with competing cable channels to their own detriment. Fox‚Äôs competition may be correct but are also STRONGLY projecting in throwing claims of propaganda and reality distortion at Fox. Trust nobody by default. Make your own calculations as to who is likely to be telling the truth. I trust Tucker because his polemicism is always well-armed with raw facts and hard-hitting reason. He pulls zero punches."
2020-03-11T18:45:45Z,Tucker is not in the ‚Äúnews‚Äù business. Literally MSNBC and CNN are dedicating whole programming hours just to educate the public on this virus. You need to have note diverse news sources if you find this Tucker segment  ground breaking.
2020-03-10T05:10:59Z,"After such a threat from China, there is no doubt that the coronavirus is a bioweapon against the United States.

The thing is, China are indeed doing better to protect its citizens, rather than telling people do not wearing masks.

2020-03-10T05:00:03Z,Tucker is the best. The only opinion host that I even remotely trust.
2020-03-10T04:58:41Z,Is it true this virus is trademarked?
2020-03-10T04:57:43Z,Hey Tucker instead of fueling more pandemonium perhaps you can discuss on the news who exactly helped us become so dependent on China so maybe they won&#39;t be re-elected now that would be real news
2020-03-10T04:57:34Z,Looks like my Boomer people are going to decrease in population.

2020-03-10T04:56:49Z,Usually Tucker is on point but this sounds like scare mongering to me.  I watch all the task force press briefings and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as inevitable a catastrophe as he says.  All data says the vast majority of cases will be mild.  No doubt it has the potential severely impact the elderly.  I do think there&#39;s too much overreaction in the market.  People are hoarding supplies like water and toilet paper.  I work with the public but I&#39;ll keep going to work and use common sense precautions.  The number one thing I can ask is that SICK PEOPLE STAY HOME.

2020-03-10T04:53:20Z,"I watched a cabinet leader repeatedly lie to you about plans for this pandemic! The truth is once the hospitals are overburdened then this will be a force multiplier for the Corona virus. The Feds have no plan, except for triage, letting many die.<br>   There is nothing or little that can be done, and perhaps 10% to 20% of the American and world population will be very sick and many will die. This is an ugly truth, a very hard truth. My wife and I are older, and may die because our leaders failed to plan, prepare and act. Dr. Glen Martin"
2020-03-10T04:53:13Z,"As I have said many times, I believe China created the coronavirus and the cure, then released the virus into the general public as a population control, the bonus for china is the virus has hit all other countries and has decided to weaponize the virus in a global war, I would take this just a serious as if they bombed the USA with a Nuke which would have been less damaging then the potential damage of the coronavirus. Obama was wrong when he said china would come to our aid, dead wrong."

2020-03-10T04:17:27Z,Most Americans were oroba ly unaware that over 90 percent t of our pharma comes from China.  I was shocked and saddened at.the revelation.  We need to get this up and running on our country NOW.

2020-03-10T04:13:45Z,Wow Foxnews going against what Donald Trump is saying. This coronavirus must be really serious.
2020-03-11T04:23:33Z,3.4% as of March 3rd
2020-03-11T04:24:41Z,Around the same mortality rate as the Spanish flu.
2020-03-10T04:13:41Z,üëçto you for speaking the truth! And not afraid of both sides.
2020-03-10T04:13:07Z,"Viruses can travel on the goods coming into the U.S.  This virus isn&#39;t as bad as many diseases we already have in the U.S., but this should be a shot above the bow.  Time to re-patriot manufacturing of medicine and medical devices as well as other products."
2020-03-10T04:12:58Z,"Please help to discover the truth. Coronavirus did not start from Bat Soup. This is a cover story for the Chinese Bio Warfare Lab, it is called a BSL 4 BioLab.¬†<br>It defies belief that the  President&#39;s military advisors are unaware of this as the USA military has Bio Labs as does every major military power. Your audience needs to know the truth about the scale of the global Bio Warfare. It is said that since 2001 the USA has invested over $150,000,000 in developing Bio Warfare. The Russian‚Äôs have these BSL4 Bio Labs and yes the Chinese. September 2019 the Chinese had a rehearsal in the same City where the outbreak has happened. Why is China getting away with this catastrophic disaster they have unleashed on the whole world."
2020-03-10T04:12:24Z,"So many people ragging on China in the comments. These viruses can come from anywhere. Just remember H1N1 came from US and killed well over 100,000. Also, calling the the &quot;Chinese Coronavirus&quot; is a blatant attempt to fit a narrative and goes against the World Health Organization&#39;s naming protocols (cannot reference places, people, or professions). Its not racist, but it&#39;s not helpful."
2020-03-10T04:13:25Z,The WHO is owned by China like how the World Bank is owned by the USA.
2020-03-10T04:16:24Z,really hilarious when US threatened to sanction countries that banned traveling with US in H1N1and now US is one of the first to ban Chinese entry üòÇ

2020-03-10T04:38:41Z,@@kaComposer For what? China has countries in its pocket through its investments and the WHO president lives in a country dependent on Chinese investment. <br>The WHO hampered containment efforts by refusing to even contact Taiwan during the outbreak due to the control held by the Chinese. The current president has made speeches praising the dictatorship for its transparency and human rights.<br><br><br>I would say it is pretty obvious.

2020-03-11T00:04:50Z,"He isn&#39;t be totally clear though. The &quot;3% mortality&quot; is vastly overestimated, because only the serious cases are being reported. Not even Spanish Influenza a hundred years ago had that mortality rate."
2020-03-11T00:43:36Z,"@@pauldraper1736 Mortality seems to vary. It&#39;s actually much higher than 3% in Italy, but so far only 0.7% in Korea. This has to be understood further. A couple of explanations I&#39;ve heard is that Italy has an older population , whereas a large number of the Korean cases are young (and also they are doing a hell of a lot of testing.) There is also a suggestion that the Korean treatment protocol includes some effective antivirals, one of them being the anti-malarial drug chloroquine. Anyway, at present 0.7% seems to be the lowest sensible estimate."

2020-03-10T03:50:52Z,"China isn&#39;t a mere commercial partner, market and supplier.  China is an active international enemy.  We need to cut all possible ties, shifting our markets to more rational, less racist and less imperialistic nations.  Maybe we might raise our national profile in Israel, for instance, which has a very well developed pharmaceutical and chemical market, and is a friendly nation.  Maybe we should interact with other Asian nations while excluding the pariah which is communist China.  They threaten us with a pharmaceutical embargo...embargo them on EVERYTHING.  Let them sell their knock-off electronics and other intellectually ripped-off products to Africa and Central Asia...and good luck with that.  The lines have already been drawn.

If they run down a company they will leave it with a multimillion severance and leave behind a bankrupted business or in hot water. If they do good they will get stock options and higher pay at the employees expense and make the gap between their paycheck and employees pay gigantic. Of course China is the best solution to them: high margins and more money in their pockets at the Americans expenses.  These psyco greedy sick mentally individuals don&#39;t run companies on behalf of stakeholders and stockholders but just for them and their greediness.

In fact, I saw something similar to this happening weeks ago when we first learned about it.I also think that if we are ever lucky enough to get the real story out of China through some information source that is not the Chinese Communists, we will see that this was probably being weaponized by the ChiComs and it got away from them from some lab planted in the middle of a residential neighborhood and not some street vendor. I agree, we need to get less dependence on foreign sources for what we have, especially China and I think we will get there with Trump but it doesn&#39;t happen overnight.Oh no, we might be inconvenienced for a bit. Big deal. The end is worth that to me anyway.

The generation that fought in World War II was the last generation that had to really endure hardships, real hardships, for the greater good. Problem is that we have lived off that largess for so long, most don&#39;t know what it means to suffer a little discomfort now to achieve the greater good for all. We have become consumed with the pursuit of things to the point that when we have to do without, it immediately causes problems, even if doing without means having to forego the Final Four tournament.

Their &quot;progressive&quot; stance on the homogenized we&#39;re-all-one world, would be very dangerous in the current quest to reclaim our economic sovereignty.

There is only irresponsible reporting for the benefit of ratings and overreaction by politicians more interested in protecting their positions or gaining more power. There will be many more people adversely affected by this artificial hysteria than actually affected by the virus.  Ask yourself whether this is best for our community.  The answer should be obvious.  Don‚Äôt buy into this media hype."

2020-03-10T03:07:02Z,China is evil and needs to be dealt with swiftly...
2020-03-10T03:07:01Z,Congratulations China on being the world&#39;s #1 exporter.... of disease.
2020-03-10T03:06:38Z,Tucker is so much wiser than Trump. When will Trump stop telling people that Coronavirus is just another flu?
2020-03-10T03:06:25Z,Everybody&#39;s pulling out of the stock market.  What you gonna do with all that money?  Oh run for President comes to mind.
2020-03-10T03:06:04Z,US Companies put all their eggs in one basket and now their all rotten...

2020-03-10T03:04:19Z,Tell me why tucker Carlson is not getting the highest medal honor!! It‚Äôs safe to say he is the only one in the media who is really care about this country. Thank you for your service tucker!!
2020-03-10T03:03:43Z,Make america manufacture again. ...
2020-03-10T03:03:28Z,"the actual mortality rate for the virus is almost certainly lower that 3.4%, just the case fatality rate is 3.4%"
2020-03-10T03:03:19Z,I hope Tucker talking to the president about telling the truth about this whole epidemic because clearly he thinks everybody is stupid and believes that this virus is contained when it&#39;s obvious that is not things that spread are not contained especially when you don&#39;t even know how it&#39;s spreading it doesn&#39;t take a lot of common sense to figure that out
2020-03-10T03:03:15Z,"If the coronavirus jumps from humans to Tucker Carlson, we‚Äôre all f@cked!"
2020-03-10T03:02:00Z,It is acshame Tucker cant do basic math either.
2020-03-10T03:01:44Z,"Tucker you are right, China is the most racist country in the world . I have lived there"
2020-03-10T03:01:26Z,FOX NEWS SUCKS
2020-03-10T03:01:26Z,Wow Tucker. Boy are you brave. You just slapped everyone. Hay someone had to tell it like it is.
2020-03-10T03:01:21Z,the CURSE !
2020-03-10T02:59:27Z,Way to skew the numbers Carlson. Coronavirus mortality rate of 3 percent is a fear mongering tactic. It is a skewed number bc it does not account for all the unreported cases that are never counted bc they don‚Äôt get tested nor seek care. Tucker must be buying in the stock market he‚Äôs helping crash. Nice going.
2020-03-10T02:59:22Z,Released on purpose to wreck our economy! Tin hats on and I still believe thatüò†

2020-03-10T02:58:50Z,Tucker my dude is on it tell these people man at least someone is telling the truth
2020-03-10T02:58:19Z,"Tucker is right covid-19 is deadlier right now than the flue, but you have to remember we have a vaccine for the flue."
2020-03-10T02:57:17Z,Exactly!!!  Twitter conservatives just keep shouting TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP. ‚ÄúYOUR A TRAITOR IF YOU BELIEVE THIS VIRUS IS WORSE THAN THE FLU. ‚Äú yeah ok so Called free speech supporters.

2020-03-10T02:56:18Z,Tucker with the fresh cut lol
2020-03-10T03:00:40Z,Aha lookin smooth
2020-03-10T02:55:55Z,"Tucker, I normally agree with you but it appears you may be overreacting.  The flu kills 250,000 to 500,000 people a year, and no one is screaming the &quot;Sky Is Falling&quot;.  The Corona Virus cannot spread above 48 degrees F.  Something the President already knew.  Stay calm, the stock market is in a panic over Oil Prices."
2020-03-10T03:04:52Z,CNN blaming Trump. FOX are calling it the Chinese Corona Virus spreading bs. This is the first example I&#39;ve seen this kinda thing on Fox.
2020-03-10T02:55:16Z,Its all nonsense...
2020-03-10T02:55:02Z,I thought Asian people were smart . . .
2020-03-10T02:55:01Z,Thanks Carlton for being the voice of reason. Hope fox doesn&#39;t cancel your program.
2020-03-10T02:54:29Z,"Why do you keep saying China and Russia are Hostile foreign powers, your not at war with either of them and trade daily with both. Holiday in both places and people that are not over 60, like each other?"
2020-03-10T02:54:13Z,"Well, if this guy insists on calling it Chinese coronavirus, the American flu killed anywhere from 17 to 100 million.  Otherwise known as Spanish flu, it originated in Kansas."
2020-03-10T02:53:59Z,"This is it my brothers and sisters, our leaders making excuses. To make it seem like we are relying on China when really by right the top 1% who control are planning to serve out that One World Government agenda. First they have to cause stock market crash then hurt the supply system. Then limit goods and cause riots to implement martial law. Then create a blackout to gather the masses and control them at the final stage. Then they usher in the regualtions and laws of a new world utopia."
2020-03-10T02:53:42Z,"I have been trying to get the point across that the Chinese Communist Party is just trying to take over the world. <br> Doesn&#39;t matter what you think people, some of us are not just doomsday cultists (so to speak), but we may even have a clue about the situation.

2020-03-10T02:52:13Z,Tucker says &quot;chicken little the sky is falling. Jerkoff! Are we going to do this every year for flue? You are stupid on this one numbnuts!
2020-03-10T02:51:28Z,"It is a pity that virus is not political or otherwise. I guess, it would be more friendly to democracy? Some people here really don&#39;t know how serious the pandemic could be. <br><br>American is biggest beneficiary from globalization because US can buy cheap goods and exploitate labor all around the world. Now Trump is calling detach US from the world. The only thing that will happen is, American people will pay much much higher for daily spendings. The states will waste tons of resources in competing Chinese, Indian and other developing countries on low-end manufacturing and let the high-tech industry, which should American economy relies on, lose its momentum of growth.<br><br><br>The greatness of America is given by the rest of the world. And it can also be disinherited from same people."
2020-03-10T02:51:20Z,It&#39;s a pandemic. And this administration has had 3 years to change things. Also Trump was saying it&#39;s just the flu a week and a half ago. Open your eyes people. Listen to your local health authority not these bozos.
2020-03-10T02:51:19Z,Great info!

2020-03-10T02:49:53Z,"the virus belongs to china so does the bill. China now owes us way more than the national debt to them, they owe us and all the other countries too, especially Italy.  China should go broke for this suffering they have created.  The CCP is corrupt and their people hungry for any living creature they can sink their teeth into or carve into little trinkets. China is a virus itself."

2020-03-10T02:46:45Z,Nobody is addressing the source of the virus. The unbelievable cruelty to animals inflicted by Chinese in farms and to wildlife. Even the way they consume food is inhuman - eaten alive is something out of horror movies but very real in China. Nature is fighting back the only way it knows how.
2020-03-10T02:45:58Z,TRUMP IS LYING WHILE AMERICANS ARE DYING!!!!
2020-03-10T02:45:38Z,"Amazing, thanks for reporting the truth."
2020-03-10T02:45:08Z,I&#39;m a Tucker Carlsen fan; but what&#39;s he doing on this high horse now? Who is he calling out? What alarm bells does he feel are not ringing??  I agree with him that our supply chain should never have been placed in the hands of the Chinese. But hasn&#39;t that been one of Donald Trump&#39;s agenda items that brought him to office in the first place?? I don&#39;t see where Tucker has used his broadcast platform in the last several years to raise awareness on the issues he now says &quot;our leaders&quot; should better manage in this crisis.

2020-03-10T02:44:07Z,Keep spreading the fear Tucker. We have problems already to get masks medical supplies.  Instead of telling us how bad it will get support us to get the help we need. WHERE can we get products to prepare for this virus....every place I have looked sold out and don&#39;t know when they will be replaced. LOOKS LIKE CHINA HAS US RIGHT WHERE THEY WANT US.
2020-03-10T02:44:03Z,Only a complete moron would look at the official stats on corona and think it was news. This is all social control and anti Chinese warmongering propaganda. Do you really want peace because you sure do not act like it. The first step would be to show respect for your enemy.

2020-03-10T13:50:05Z,Naomi Hall Do you have any idea about economics? Freedom of the market? If you want to maintain jobs here you have to implemented import taxes which raise prices for everyone in America. China can just produce stuff cheaper and free business will go the cheaper route. Trump is not gonna change that except if he turns America into a communist country. Then he could dictate where companies get their materials from. Do you want that?

Think I&#39;m crazy?  Take it up with God.  He placed prophecy about these days all over the Holy Bible.  The worst is yet to come.  He reveals an escape plan through Jesus Christ.

2020-03-10T02:22:22Z,"Tucker Carlson is the best and trusted TV Journalist  of our time. True facts  are hard to digest these days , specially when country n it‚Äôs ppl are is fooled by these fake media‚Äôs."
2020-03-10T02:22:19Z,The US is probably next to be locked down. Smh
2020-03-10T02:22:09Z,"Wow, very rarely do I disagree with tucker but I definitely do here. This virus is nothing to panic over. While it&#39;s nothing good, its definitely NOT a pandemic."
2020-03-10T02:21:59Z,We need to Waterboard Bill Gates for the truth
2020-03-10T02:21:38Z,"Bring factories back and jobs , to our people and our country. America first . üòòüá∫üá∏"
2020-03-10T02:21:37Z,"I am sorry Tucker. China is hostile bc America has been hostile for a long time. Go back to all that the US has done to thwart China&#39;s progress &amp; growth. America is, and has been hostile to any nations that are not maleable to its whims. Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia, and other Latin American countries have tasted that vicious and bloody hostility. Iraq, Libya, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Yemen, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, N &amp; S Koreas, Russia, the list goes on, have bloody history w/America. So Tucker, it is disingenuous to label others as threatening, backward, or hostile to America, who has been the antagonist for far too long. You are not helping America come to terms w/its own egregious behaviour in the world. To be great is to be able to acknowledge its mistakes &amp; sins, reform &amp; transform - that is the only way forward in the 21st century. Win-lose must not be the motto for any country any more. We see the upheaval &amp; major seismic changes in the fault line of the int&#39;l platform of diplomacy, trade, foreign relationships &amp; cooperation. America is  left increasingly w/very little to stand on as it is. So wise up. Trump wants friendly relationships &amp; trade to take America forward. What is not to like about this very sensible goal?"
2020-03-10T02:21:15Z,Lebron James will say that Americans are to blame while trying to make a sale on tennis shoes!
2020-03-10T02:20:59Z,"Tucker Carlson is one side of the American Gollum. Smart, selfish, mean,  aggressive, offensive, and hypocritical.  Sometimes very jealous."
2020-03-10T02:20:38Z,"someone better reminder China, when push comes to shove, WE&#39;LL JUST TAKE WHAT WE WANT"
2020-03-10T12:52:38Z,"Haha...even though china has all of our technology and then some, stolen from us or otherwise, and a billion or so more people?...haha..I&#39;m sure theyd welcome us to come try and take it"
2020-03-10T12:59:58Z,"But I will say, if they invaded us and tried to take our stuff theyd probably lose...only because we have an armed citizenry...for now at least"
2020-03-10T02:20:31Z,"Be protective of chronically ill people.   They are the ones who might lose their lives, just like with flu.."
2020-03-10T02:20:09Z,Evening brother hope you and your family are nicely settled in
2020-03-10T02:20:09Z,Why have a government at all if this is how they respond to this. We are only as safe as the least insured among us. Medicare for all. Let‚Äôs get one thing from the government besides war and subsides for corporations. Either that or bank runs and tax revolt. What am I paying taxes for?
2020-03-10T02:19:34Z,Can&#39;t believe Tucker lately. He sounds like the rest of the msm! This is all ds hype to bring down the economy and make our president look bad before the election. This virus is no deadlier than the regular flu
2020-03-11T08:13:48Z,Wow. Certainly can&#39;t help a cultist like you. At least wash your hands and cover your coughs. Spare the high risk people of your ignorance.
2020-03-10T02:19:32Z,The Wuflu.
2020-03-10T02:19:13Z,Recession? TRUMPS BLOOD PRESSURE IS ABOUT TO GO UP
2020-03-10T02:18:26Z,"And yet AGAIN...<br>Trump was CORRECT <br>that America is too dependent on Foreign Nations, &amp; our <br>NATIONAL SECURITY <br>depends on bringing manufacturing HOME‚ùóÔ∏è<br>Give him credit ,<br>he sees the future‚ÄºÔ∏è"
2020-03-10T02:18:12Z,I believe this will change the world. China has seen it&#39;s best days.
2020-03-10T02:17:54Z,"You go to Walmart online or Amazon and the prices for disinfectants, masks, gloves, alcohol etc has doubled or tripled."

2020-03-10T02:17:52Z,We will make the vaccine and sell it to China bahhhh hahaha
2020-03-10T02:17:47Z,It was China‚Äôs plan all along trump backed them in a corner no president in history has they let them  steal our property and so on they was just forced into the phase 1 deal soon to be phase 2 and now was the time to strike
2020-03-10T02:17:21Z,Completely agree. Upset at both sides. This isn‚Äôt political. We can‚Äôt get mad about the left making it political... and then make it political. It isn‚Äôt the end of the world but it needs to be slowed down.
2020-03-10T02:17:17Z,Ground the planes until its gone
2020-03-10T02:16:52Z,ü§£
2020-03-10T02:16:46Z,"The 3.5% mortality rate may not be wholly accurate, as persons who contract the virus and recover may never even know that it was the coronavirus they were suffering from. Additionally, is Tucker intimating that everyone who has contracted the virus has been tested for it? I doubt that is true. Right now, the outbreak is still occurring. What some people are saying in regards to the coronavirus is like saying a tornado is killing 25 people per mile while the tornado is still tearing through a populated area - before it reaches an open field and travels for miles without encountering anyone. Be cautious and don&#39;t allow numbers that are not being used judiciously to put you in a panic."
2020-03-10T02:16:29Z,"It&#39;s highly convenient that after President Trump completely demolished the Chinese economy by bringing America back to greatness, suddenly out of nowhere a new strain of the virus popped up and now as the world is on the verge of an economic crisis, China, who is a massive exporter of essential products, is threatening to halt medical supplies to the US. The US and all western nations need to become more self-sufficient and less dependent on other nations. Bringing steel and oil production back to the US was a massive first step made by Trump but more needs to be done!"
2020-03-10T02:16:10Z,It&#39;s CCP virus!
2020-03-10T02:15:52Z,Now tucker is a fear monger
2020-03-10T02:21:45Z,"I&#39;m finding this to be more and more the case.  I listen to him now because he&#39;s informative.  I take the good and sift through the nonsense, though I&#39;d really prefer not to have to do that."
2020-03-10T02:15:50Z,"Now, wait.  Harris Faulkner had an hour long segment today with Dr. Oz stating if you&#39;re healthy, under 60...go out and live life..travel, do the normal things but always wash your hands.  If you get COVID-19, chances are, you won&#39;t even know it bc symptoms will be little to none.  It&#39;s the over 60 who need to take precautions.  This evening, we have Tucker Carlson saying life is changing as we know it and even tho remain calm don&#39;t be complacent b/c this is a big deal.  We have so many mixed messages the public doesn&#39;t know what to do."
2020-03-10T02:15:46Z,"Madical supplies come from India,Israel and Ireland too,but the problem is the primary ingredients they get itfrom China too."
2020-03-10T02:15:44Z,Wow Tucker I could have sworn you were still working at CNN!! How much fear do you want to spread?
2020-03-10T02:15:37Z,"What Tucker Carlson is saying here is dangerous. He&#39;s claiming that the fatality rate is higher than it probably is because there are people infected who might not even know they&#39;re affected and will get well. The family of the lawyer in Rochester who is one of the first cases in New York been tested positive yet the children and the wife have a minor cough and a fever, while their father is in critical care and probably will survive. There is no actual indication that the fatality rate is 3.4% that as it may right now cannot be calculated. Tucker would do well to have dr. Drew on his show and actual doctor Who is stating the right things. This is not worse than the flu , it&#39;s not worse than SARS, it&#39;s not worse than MERS , and it&#39;s certainly not worse than Ebola,  none of those diseases from 2009 on were met with such Hysteria then this virus"
2020-03-10T02:15:25Z,Dogs &amp; cats living together...
2020-03-10T02:15:11Z,Send those deaths rate numbers to TRUMP please
2020-03-10T02:14:53Z,Dont blame China for your own incompetenc.
2020-03-10T02:14:34Z,No good news to report tonight <br>Trump failed the American people. <br>And the soldiers that fought and died for this country.
2020-03-10T02:14:16Z,That‚Äôs TRUMP position
2020-03-10T02:14:16Z,"Wow Tucker, I appreciate you for this segment. Not sure how much you said are fact but I‚Äôll give you a much higher percentage than other Fox News shows. Those morons on ‚ÄúThe Five‚Äù have feed false facts and poor opinions. Please stay on track and give our people solid journalism and facts the best you know them. Thank you from a non fan of Fox. I watch to see what both sides are saying FOX/CNN and you‚Äôre telling the information closely to medical experts.  Thank You."
2020-03-10T02:13:59Z,If China throws Sanctions at us then We will be In a Great Depression far greater then the Great Depression of 1929-1930&#39;s. Since were so dependent on them
2020-03-10T02:13:39Z,The biggest problem BY FAR is that the healthcare system is not going to be able to handle it. The hospitals will be overwhelmed and eventually (soon) ppl suffering from severe Covid19 will not be able to get proper medical treatment and neither will ppl who are suffering from other non-Covid 19 life-threatening events.
2020-03-10T02:13:24Z,Finally Tucker is making sense!!!
2020-03-10T02:13:24Z,45000 vs 24.... im rushing out to buy hand sanitizer...lol
2020-03-10T02:13:16Z,"I lived through SARS in 2003, the current coronovirus is a much less lethal virus. In Singapore, we have been through 6 weeks of coronovirus, but businesses have already started to recover... As long as the government takes enough preventive measures, and there isn&#39;t exponential growth in infections, consumers will come out again. We have been through what the US has been going through, the first 3 weeks of the coronovirus everyone acted as if the world is coming to an end, stock markets crashed, but now, shopping centers are full again, the proportion of people wearing masks have decreased from 50% to 10%...It is still very important to take hygiene way more seriously and be wary about getting infected but as long as all the measures are taken, sure enough we are still getting like a handful of new cases a day, but it isn&#39;t exponential growth... People are not falling ill and dying left right center. I&#39;m pretty sure the market will stop their panic. When temperatures rise a bit more, i&#39;m pretty sure the virus will naturally slow down. If you look at the numbers coming out from countries near the equator, the spread of the virus is kinda constant or linear growth, exponential growth was only seen in temperate countries like Korea and China. Likewise in 2003 SARS was really bad because it happened in winter, come half year later in summer, it was gone."
2020-03-10T02:13:08Z,Only reason the governments are not criticizing the Chinese is because of money and being deny access to their marketa
2020-03-10T02:13:07Z,One thing that will come out of this is maybe I&#39;ll be able to buy  a  can opener made in the USA not some thing that breaks after two uses...
2020-03-10T02:12:37Z,Zinc in the cells is really important to help protect. There have been recent studies showing this. It takes a while for zinc to build up inside the cells.

2020-03-10T10:41:48Z,@@davids.2703 only 3800 have dead from this so far. For the love of God stop saying it&#39;s higher.
2020-03-10T13:55:14Z,"@@evacody1249 it&#39;s only going to go higher, especially if Trump keeps downplaying the risk and saying people are okay to go to work sick"
2020-03-10T02:12:26Z,Tucker Carlson....your MONOLOGUES..are boring...your show going down .look a like MSM
2020-03-10T02:12:11Z,Thanks Tucker. Keeping it real.
2020-03-10T12:04:28Z,I hope Trump comes around too. I was disappointed by his &quot;go to work if you&#39;re sick statement&quot;. Our country could be hurt the worst and the economical impact would far outweigh his ego.
2020-03-10T12:04:57Z,I dont agree with tucker or fox news on everything but he&#39;s being kocking out the park lately.
2020-03-10T02:12:08Z,How is the economy? Is America great again?ü§£
2020-03-10T02:12:01Z,Your president is complacent.
2020-03-10T02:11:47Z,"Trump to continue his Keynesian economics of spending, money printing to fix a pandemic, this is not a tax issue or a debt issue we have more than enough of that."
2020-03-10T02:11:25Z,"Fearmongering people. It was predictable. It&#39;s their last card they could play. It wont work just like everything else they&#39;ve tried. Stay calm, stay alert, stay clean. Over by April."
2020-03-10T02:11:17Z,"I respectfully disagree. If China refuses to sell the USA medical supplies, they will bankrupt themselves and the USA will buy from other sources at a slightly higher cost. As for the analysis of how bad COVID-19 is, it is way off. Italy is over-reacting. It is evidence only of their panic. The stock market went down largely due to media-induced panic and Russia and Saudi Arabia going to blows over the production of oil. The mortality rate is not nearly as high as that cited either because mild cases of it are not making the reporting. The deaths from flu are going to be way more than COVID-19. The left and their allies in the MSM are taking advantage. Let&#39;s not let them."
2020-03-10T02:10:47Z,"Trumpets think if they worship their idol Trump more, he will protect them from disease. Give me a break."
2020-03-10T02:09:27Z,"You conflated the statement from the CCP with the sentiments of an entire population; even if somewhat correct, you ignore the historical context.  Is this the best that humanity is capable of?  Are you not in some position of leadership?  Can you do better please?"
2020-03-10T02:09:21Z,"Tucker does not like the idea of being threatened by another country? But has no problems w/America sanctioning  countries, foreign businesses and individuals w/sanctions, visa rejection, financial transactions, business transactions - unfairly &amp; illegally???!!!"
2020-03-10T02:09:00Z,"Tucker, why did the guy you had on tonight walk back what he said earlier on Fox business? He said earlier that LabCorp and other places had tests. But then on your show, he said he couldn&#39;t find any? Two different messages on the same network from the same guy on the same day?"
2020-03-10T02:08:52Z,"Our leaders sold us out to China just to make a few extra pennies on the dollar and get some nice kickbacks. Their people suffered the consequences--lost jobs, closed businesses, decreased wages, complete capitulation to Chinese whims in our cultural products as to not upset our financial overlords. Selling out to China has empowered and made rich the evilest of people, and made poorer the most innocent folks. Never forgive what they have done to us. We should not wish for anyone to burn in hell, but they shall--for they are the epitome of satanic."
2020-03-10T02:08:51Z,The financial damage wont last until the end of April
2020-03-10T02:08:48Z,"Tucker, you are awesome and, as usual correct. Thanks for your honesty. Hopefully honesty will finally become as contagious as this virus. I&#39;m so sick and tired of the outright lies and deceit"
2020-03-10T11:33:15Z,"He is racist, bigoted, evil and incorrect. So why would you call him awesome? What&#39;s wrong with you. I just looked you up for $1 - got your home address and phone. iF I called you up saying what he said to you what would you feel? Let&#39;s try it to the other persons listed in your household records."

2020-03-10T02:07:58Z,Why aren&#39;t the state governments taking precautions for their states? They shouldn&#39;t wait for the federal government to quarantine people who might be infected.
2020-03-10T02:07:34Z,Trump said that we‚Äôll be fine. Pence is currently praying it away for us all. Nothing to worry about here folks.
2020-03-10T02:07:32Z,Hi Tucker üëçüèª
2020-03-10T02:07:23Z,"When did viruses become people? The flu is also a strain of the coronavirus, but Tucker doesn&#39;t care the the &quot;American&quot; flu kills Americans, it that &quot;Chinese&quot; flu that matters."
2020-03-10T02:06:58Z,This is the reality of depending on foreign Nations!
2020-03-10T02:06:57Z,"Well  Tucker, you showed yourself out. You believe the &quot;progressive &quot; deep state, and you are terrified. It does take faith, courage and character to push back on evil. I hope you trust in God and Trump and get back into this fight for America ."
2020-03-10T02:06:46Z,"This is Trump‚Äôs Hurricane Katrina. Too little, too late. Minimise, blame, deny. People need leadership and truth, not this bs."
2020-03-10T02:06:45Z,"Democrats intentionally shipped our manufacturing to foreign countries! Obama , Clinton, Globalists put us in this position.  Most likely, for just such an &quot;event.&quot;  Population reduction, etc.  People in despair are so much likely to give up remaining rights and freedoms to ease suffering.  They put us in the hands of the Chinese.  You think Obama, Clinton or even Bush will be negatively affected?  Think again!"
2020-03-10T02:06:15Z,"Fox News&#39; headline asked if China should apologise to the world for the coronavirus outbreak. So China is responding to that. Tucker should get this straight. Fox fired the first shot by Maria, and McCarthy happily supplied more China blaming animus into that interview. Right to respond does not go down well w/some people in Fox News now?!"
2020-03-10T02:05:54Z,Who agrees to let China control our medicinal supplies? I want to know?

2020-03-10T02:05:50Z,"Thanks Tucker, great piece"
2020-03-10T02:05:12Z,What Chinese media was he quoting from?  Sounds like a Chinese version of Fox News... I have not heard of this threat of cutting off medical supplies and I live in China.  I think this is one of those times human beings should work together to fight a common enemy.
2020-03-10T02:04:47Z,The Chicons will eat anything that walks on four legs or crawls or flys. Any wonder why this is happening? DUH
2020-03-10T02:04:28Z,"Where‚Äôs mike Bloomberg now, could‚Äôve easily made a couple anabiotic‚Äôs factories with the wasted money on that BS campaign run!! Trump needs to get on this now regardless of the corona virus!!"
2020-03-10T02:03:57Z,"Bring it China. Plays your stupid games and your finished. What innovations come out of China anyway? That they haven‚Äôt stolen! We need to untangle ourselves from these commie crooks once and for all and any presidential candidate that doesn‚Äôt consider China the foremost threat to America is worthless. That‚Äôs why I voted for President Trump and will vote for him again. We had decades of globalist pigs exporting American innovation, and treasure to China through crap trade deals and looking the other way. It stops now."
2020-03-10T02:03:38Z,"all countries should demand China helps pay for what they have unleashed on the world , and if they will not , there should be boycots until they agree to #1 pay for the damage they have done , #2 do more to make sure it never happens again and #3 and tell all countries sooner if it happens again"
2020-03-10T02:03:35Z,"Tucker, epidemics and wars are created to control the world‚Äôs population. So, what‚Äôs the fuss for? No panic, no vaccine will help the people whose time is up in this world."
2020-03-10T02:01:54Z,"If we stick with even the most conservative estimate of the case fatality rate of 1% with only one million infected, that&#39;s ten thousand deaths. And we know it&#39;ll definitely be more than only a million people getting infected with this virus. Let&#39;s be real, this is about what&#39;s your probability of surviving this? No way to know. Still too soon."
2020-03-10T02:01:20Z,"Guess we better start making our own stuff again, about time, should have never come to this."
2020-03-10T07:41:27Z,"J. De Los Santos You meant to say that American politicians and business leaders were too lazy, pompous and entitled to refrain from moving the manufacturing base offshore to countries where workers will work all day for nickels and a bowl of rice.<br><br>Fixed it for you."
2020-03-10T07:44:05Z,This crisis will leave us with many lessons to learn and act upon.
2020-03-10T11:11:39Z,"Lol it would never happen. U.S. workers won&#39;t take cheap pay. So you can&#39;t compete with chinas cheap labor. Besides, China owns 90 percent of the of the worlds rare earth minerals."

2020-03-10T01:59:43Z,"My state of WA got Corona the same time china did and its spread like wildfire, this 3% mortality rate is unfounded and madeup there has been 0 testing to see how many have had Corona and barely any testing w its 3000 price tag. This is a planned economic reset."
2020-03-10T01:59:23Z,"China has already nationalized the company 3M that makes masks, and gloves. <br>If Saudi Arabia started the Iraq war for Trillions in profit selling oil. <br>China may follow the same business plan by starting a epidemic, and cornering the medical market for profit. <br>We will always be at the mercy of the global evil, and greedy if we continue to be interdependent on our global competitors."

So correction here: China is a top down and bottom up govt. By that it means, communication is two-way. They have more than 2,000 provincial and local representatives to the central govt for policies or local needs.<br>Iran is not a backward country bc of incompetent govt. Its economic growth  has been hampered by America&#39;s decades long sanctions since the Ayatollah Khomeini overturned America&#39;s puppet Shah. We see the oil embargo &amp; other trade restrictions placed on Iran, similarly done to Venezuela, that is to destabilize the country to bring it to its knees before the &#39;great bully&#39;.

You will see the effects of this in the coming weeks and it will be very painful. Thank the banks, former presidents/ politicians and corporations for selling you out. It took them all to sell us out and leave us swimming naked. The ones of you that survive hopefully will learn from this.

2020-03-10T12:54:05Z,"@@chuclancy5447 2. By the way - did you read what I had said.. Here  - read it and grasp why I say this. Can you do that and comment?<br><br><br><br>1. Howie, the Shocking truth is that We need to SALUTE THE NATION OF CHINA !!!!  Why? <br><br><br>The virus is from &quot;China&quot; but it is not a &quot;Chinese virus&quot;. Mother nature creates virus using evolution [which itself is blind].  It could have happened anywhere on earth. There is no &quot;blaming&quot; China - as far as America is concerned.<br><br>In fact we need to praise China for &quot;sharing all the information, inviting W.H.O and Americans&quot; as soon as they were able to do that - DESPITE officially being communist and a &quot;Closed nation when it comes to information&quot; . They did us a HUGE favor by being ahead of things and on top of their game.  They went against their own internal historic policy of secrecy for us, for Uncle Sam. We salute all of the Chinese government as Americans.<br><br>As Chinese citizens they can legit be mad at their government for initial secrecy. That&#39;s none of our business.<br><br>As for Tucker: he is directly racist against the Chinese. He is knowingly racist.<br><br>2.  Globalism is bad? Someone said that! I replied:<br><br>You are correct. But &quot;how so&quot; ? <br><br>Capitalism is embedded in a democracy. So the law must always apply against fraud or force. Further, the governments job is to make certain vital products to national interests must NEVER be from any &quot;one&quot; source or nation [e.g. China]. <br><br>How are you wrong? You assume that government can interfere in economic affairs. It can not and must not - because to do so is &quot;Anti capitalism&quot; meaning it is socialism (regardless of the name of the party as Republican or other).<br><br>Upon MY premises the U.S.A was formed, found and lived from 1776 to 1916 when there was interference by government into economics starting with taxation upon the very rich. Eventually with each generation, once there&#39;s a tear , they kept on tearing the sheet until you pay for this daily even reading THIS post - you pay tax on utilities (e.g. to charge your phone or charged).<br><br>In summary and to repeat: Globalism IS capitalism. But Globalism does NOT mean one has to RELY on emergency and vital items from any ONE source. In fact it is GLOBALISM that will enable us to have RESILIENCE by having MANY MORE sources - not just &quot;America&quot;, nor just &quot;China&quot; to <b>supply</b> and/or * make the products*** and make them far cheaper just like China does AND THEREFORE we the U.S.A benefit.  ALWAYS SUPPORT LIBERTY: this means capitalism. That means globalism."

Fox has been leaning more and more towards what the other cable news have been doing since Trump got elected.

Such extraordinary efforts have resulted in a growing positive momentum in epidemic control across the country. In the course of this fight, China has followed its vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, lived up to its responsibility as a major country and made a substantial contribution to global public health.<br><br>China has demonstrated its sense of responsibility by curbing the global spread of the virus. Standing at the forefront of the fight, China has fulfilled its responsibility for global public health as well as for its own people. It has taken the most decisive and thorough measures to contain the spread of the virus beyond its borders. Chinese medical workers and researchers have raced against time to improve diagnostic and therapeutic solutions in an effort to raise the cure rate and lower the case fatality rate. With its quick response, China has bought precious time for the international community to enhance preparedness; with its forceful response, China has served as a strong line of defense against the spread of the epidemic.<br><br>UN Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres described China‚Äôs sacrifice in containing the spread of the novel coronavirus as a great contribution to all mankind. World Health Organisation Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted that China‚Äôs forceful actions have limited the spread of the virus both domestically and beyond its borders. China is protecting not only its own people, but also the rest of the world."

Let‚Äôs not forget that It was mid January when Chinese officials were in US soil to sign a trade deal at the WhiteHouse. Hold China accountable for this pandemic. Thus, it must let US staff go in to investigate, provide autopsy. That‚Äôs the least thing they can do for humanity so that we can speed up vaccine process.

Perhaps a rushed, completely untested vaccine is on route that will rake in countless billions, whereas vitamin C is rather inexpensive and safe...

2020-03-10T01:04:37Z,"It didn&#39;t originate from a meat market in China. There are 100,000 meat markets in CHina.  &quot;It came from one meat market&quot; - mere yards from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,  China&#39;s top level bioweapons lab.  The Laws of Probability overwhelmingly say it came from the lab.  Common sense says the same."
2020-03-10T01:04:37Z,"Why can‚Äôt we all focus on protecting ourselves, protecting our family and  our community.   Being united to stop the spread? If China has the resource to recover the sick, why would it hurt to ask for help to save the American people?  isn‚Äôt the lives of the American people more important than pride.  We need to stop our negative thoughts and go forward looking for resolution.  Also,, I don‚Äôt believe China hate the Americans,  they don‚Äôt hate us. Your statement would only cause more hatred in the American people to go against the chinese community bringing more  harassment, bullying and fights etc."

Covid-19 will follow the same path from epidemic to pandemic to endemic as SARS and MERS before.   What&#39;s different is the panic.  Panic can lead to great loss of life.  Tucker is fine but he&#39;s obviously not the sharpest tool in the shed.

Unless you are very old or ill,  this virus may pose no threat.  While easy to contract  -   it is not known to be deadly here in the US,  24 deaths is saddening but not a major threat as more people die of the flu.    Things will change one way or another.    In China,  IV Vitamin C is used to treat this virus.   I do not see America using that much common sense.   I see American and Big Pharma forcing American to get vaccinated.  Most of us probably already have made contact with it."

2020-03-10T00:53:10Z,"Tucker you threw out a lot of numbers that have no basis in fact. We cannot determine morality rates because we do not know everyone who has the virus and will not know. The 2,000 drop is almost all from the oil tit-for-tat between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Tucker you used to be pure news and reasonable editorial, but you are well into the pure speculative and tossing around junk facts, which you used to lambaste so many for doing. Shame, you had a promising start. Time will tell, exactly what this is all about and you are going to look foolish."

2020-03-10T00:53:10Z,Tucker Carlson is not an expert on epidemics and diseases. He may be mistaken about this. The president is doing a great deal. He authorized an 8 billion dollar budget to fight coronavirus. He is doing more and more for it. Tucker may be an alarmist and not an expert on this.

2020-03-10T03:14:04Z,"it&#39;s a cold that requires anywhere from 10-20% of the people that get it to receive assistance with breathing or they would die. Especially those with chronic conditions like you. Please rely on more than just Jesus to save you. There&#39;s a story about a man who&#39;s trying to survive a flood. A car drives by and offers him a ride, he refuses to get in, saying that he is praying to god, and that god will save him. the water gets higher, and he goes onto the roof to keep praying. A boat comes by and offers to rescue him, he says no, my god will save me, and keeps praying. Then a helicopter comes, but he waves that off too, insisting that he is praying to god, and that that is all the help he needs. He eventually drowns. When he gets to heaven, he asks god why he didn&#39;t save him. god responds &quot;I sent a car, a boat, and a helicopter, what more did you need?&quot;. Please do not be like that man. Maybe Christ is trying to help you in mysterious ways, but giving you a warning from Tucker Carlson? This is shaping up to be Spanish Flu 2.0, please be safe internet stranger."
