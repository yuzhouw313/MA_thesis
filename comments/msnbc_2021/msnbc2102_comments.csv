2021-02-26T11:57:55Z,Watch CPAC ON FOX NEWS THIS WEEKEND.  STARTS TODAY...
2021-02-26T07:35:06Z,"Here is an idea: create virus-free areas where people are only allowed to enter after test and quarantine. Then keep expanding and multiplying those areas until they cover the entire country, the entire world.<br>By testing and moving people, it is possible to expand the virus-free areas and shrink the infected areas.<br>The advantage is that you allow the economic activities to continue normally BOTH in the infected and virus-free areas.<br>People in virus-free areas are free to travel to any other virus-free areas.<br>And people from infected areas are free to travel to any other infected areas.<br>Only people who need to cross the borders of areas like truck drivers need to take some special precautions.<br>As infected areas shrink, it becomes easier and easier to stop the spread of the virus, as you know exactly where the virus is and can allocate more and more resources.<br><br>In theory it is much easier to close the borders of a single city than an entire country.<br>Determine which cities are infected and which cities are virus-free.<br>Close the borders of these areas or cities.<br>People who want to move from infected areas to virus-free areas need to be tested and quarantined.<br>The problem with most countries is that they are secretly aiming for herd immunity because they only try to SLOW the spread of the virus. But it doesn&#39;t matter if it is slow or quick, the virus is still SPREADING, and it will only stop when there are no more people to infect, which is the definition of herd immunity.<br>Instead of mitigation, we should aim for eradication.<br>Instead of slowing the spread, we should STOP the spread of the virus.<br>We can stop the spread of the virus by closing borders.<br>The virus is carried by people. If people cannot cross borders, neither can the virus.<br>You can completely block the virus from entering a certain region by closing the borders.<br>Country borders are already closed all over the world, why not close the borders of cities?<br>The closure is temporary if you test and move people to expand the virus-free areas and shrink the infected areas.<br>Most people live and work in the same city. Even if the city borders were closed, the disruption to their normal lives would be minimal. For most people nothing would change.<br>Trying to close down bars and restaurants is ludicrous and impossible. It is very easy for people to SECRETLY open bars and restaurants, have religious meetings, private parties, etc. You would need a police officer in every single household in the city to keep an eye on people but there is not enough police officers to do that.<br>On the other hand closing city borders is much easier. For most cities there are only a few points of entry. Putting police officers permanently in those points of entry is easy.<br>And technically the city borders would still be open. People would be required to be tested and quarantined in order to cross the border, that is all. After the quarantine people would be free to go anywhere they want in the virus-free areas,  unrestricted, completely assured they are not infected.<br>It is possible for the test to be completely voluntary. The test does not need to be mandatory.<br>It is also possible to consider an area virus-free without any testing.<br>There are many cities all over the world that can already be considered virus-free simply because they have not reported any hospitalizations due to COVID-19 in the last few weeks.<br>If you don&#39;t want to be tested or quarantined, you can simply stay in your own area until it is considered virus-free, because according to my plan all regions sooner or later become virus-free."
2021-02-25T10:52:25Z,&quot;The world has 6.8 billion people ‚Ä¶. Now if we do a really good job with new vaccines ‚Ä¶. we<br>could reduce that by 10-15%&quot; Bill Gates 2015 TED talk.
2021-02-23T18:48:31Z,"Fauci and the supposedly other experts in viral diseases should know better to spread lies about cloth and surgical masks being a protection against a virus. If that were true, then all the lab techs, scientist, and doctors that work with viruses need to stop wasting money by wearing pressurized suits and hoods when handling viruses. <br>Also, what happened to the 10s of thousands of flu cases and other deadly health incidents since the  COVID-19 pandemic started. Could it be each and every death since the COVID-19 pandemic started was labeled as a COVID-19 death to exaggerate the deaths and create fear and panic in order to control a narrative and the people for some group&#39;s agenda. Think about it! What happened to the deaths due to fly, pneumonia, cancer, heart attacks, diabetes, etc. Nothing recorded in the news or in obituaries on these past prominent causes of death. Wakeup people!"
2021-02-23T03:22:01Z,It showed that the pfizer vaccine is 90% effective with 1 dose. Why not vaccinate more with 1 dose then? Opps they just asked that! Lol

2021-02-22T22:01:37Z,"The higher numbers of  vaccinations, the fewer human cesspools to breed new mutations."
2021-02-22T17:15:24Z,"You think? Hello, duh. The only weapon we have against microbiology is our brains. Use it!"
2021-02-21T00:50:08Z,I will face death for Jesus !

2021-02-25T07:49:52Z,"Good luck, stay safe"
2021-02-28T05:17:35Z,The vaccine is more dangerous than the virus!
2021-02-20T00:15:58Z,"Stop worrying about which subgroup gets the vaccine first. Just send the vaccine to drug stores, like they do flu vaccines, and let anyone over 55 (the group most likely to die from Covid) get the vaccine."
2021-02-19T23:59:30Z,LOL so the vax is a useful as a wind turbine in a snowstorm.
2021-02-19T23:34:43Z,Biden is your president Who claims no vaccines were in the USA before he was president Yet millions were already vaccinated ? ü§î this guy is crooked . Outside looking in he is probably worse than trump. Why ? Cos trump at least never flip flopped or tried to appease everyone and at least had some sort of principle . Be it good or bad . That to me is at least a leader. I say outside looking in as I‚Äôm not American

2021-02-19T23:46:01Z,Trump spent months downplaying Covid and then held rallies all over the country in the fall just before the biggest wave . He likely did more to spread Covid than any other single person on Earth
2021-02-19T23:32:44Z,I just let people who wants to vaccinate vaccinate
2021-02-20T01:19:25Z,Yes but the problem is find the true information and truest places for three days I‚Äôm looking and trying I can‚Äôt find nothing any sites any telephone ‚òéÔ∏è nothing I‚Äôm 67 years old ü•µ
