2021-03-13T06:14:40Z,Every Covid denier should be forced to go into a Covid ward and see what their &quot;hoax&quot; really looks like.

The other 2 lived less then a block away. Even though the Governor said....... nvrm can’t get go over that subject again. It makes me sick."
2021-03-12T23:02:10Z,"45 never wanted to know their names, see their faces or hear their stories. He doesn&#39;t care, he honestly does NOT care. It&#39;s it only honest thing about him."
2021-03-12T21:08:38Z,"Republicans are saying that Biden doing what they would not do is a mistake. Do not forget that the &#39;freedom protests &amp; anti-masker talk&#39; that started last April grew into &#39;let&#39;s open up&#39; in May. It was a plan. Red states quietly picked up &#39;herd immunity&#39; policies. It expressed itself as &#39;Say anything but, in fact, do nothing.&#39; Trump loved this ... it killed 150,000 extra people. Now they want to repeat with spring break."

2021-03-12T20:22:33Z,"We&#39;re still losing 1,500 Americans per day. So while it&#39;s much better than the 4,000 per day in January, we&#39;re essentially where we were in July 2020. <br>Stay focused people...just a little longer...let&#39;s save some lives! 🙌"

2021-03-12T18:06:39Z,"Let us come together here to remember...not to spread lies and hate. But to bond together,  to forget and forgive....let this be a place of hope and peace for those who remain...leave the negative behind and join together to heal, to stop nasty negative words from fall on tearful hearts, instead as the Lord God of Heaven tells us in His guide book...to love one another regardless of race or color....all human life has worth....let&#39;s celabrate that."
2021-03-12T18:22:52Z,It’s true and best not to add to the hate from one man who conned so many.
2021-03-12T23:17:54Z,"There is no forgiveness for those who have no remorse.  NEVER  forget the catastrophic response lest  it be repeated. Remember those responsible for the carnage. Accountability for so much suffering. Then move on. That is not hate, that is justice for the 528000 dead Americans That&#39;s how we honor the lost and protect the living."
2021-03-12T18:00:38Z,“celebrating”  Go Biden
2021-03-12T18:00:01Z,"At work, I’ve had to edit a LOT of obituaries for people killed by Covid-19. It’s so sad, reading stories mostly - but by no means exclusively - about old people, and the lives and loves they had, most of which were much more impressive and diverse than mine, only for them be cruelly killed by that awful virus. They All mattered, and I feel so sorry for them, personally, and those they left behind. Rest in peace."
2021-03-12T17:59:42Z,"What should weigh on every American’s conscience must be the deaths of more than 528,000 and the suffering of millions due to the negligence of 45 and his cronies."
2021-03-12T17:55:21Z,A lot of lost
2021-03-12T17:46:56Z,Powerful stuff
2021-03-12T17:46:11Z,"OMG, crying now watching this."
2021-03-12T17:40:32Z,"“Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” -JESUS<br>‭‭Matthew‬ ‭<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM83s4ehWd0&amp;t=11m28s"">11:28</a>-30‬"
2021-03-12T17:38:55Z,"KUDOS to you Nicole Wallace for being the &#39;pioneer&#39; in recognizing the need for celebrating those lost to this pandemic with &#39;Lives Well Lived&#39; - bittersweet as it is.  When watching Deadline White House, I remember the first &#39;celebration&#39; and the tears streamed down because these lives represent the REAL authentic American treasure - such a sad waste, indeed!  PLEASE Nicole,...as difficult as it is - and I really don&#39;t know how you do this - continue this Lives Well Lived.  Bless you, indeed!"
