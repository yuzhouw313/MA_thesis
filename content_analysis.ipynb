I have thought it was possible from the beginning that it was a manufactured virus, I have thought it was possible from the beginning that it was intentionally released. The first hurdle is proving if what she said is true from her research, and trusting that those vetting her research are not biased/influenced/or threatened with a counter agenda. The second hurdle, well, disproving her research does not mean the CCP were not negligible nor complicit, it just means her research does not prove it. But worst of all, what happens if she is right? Do we go to war? Lets say we just do sanctions, how is that justice? Lets say we want justice, that would mean war, and given the military and resources they have gained in the last half a century, how well will that turn out for the world? How much land, resources, politicians, celebrities do they own in the west? How much corrupted tech have they sold into use in the US Military? How much access do they have in our digital infrastructure? I think the best thing to do is ween ourselves and our allies off their manufacturing industry, immediately.\n",

      "Comment: The problem here is a damned if you do damned if you don&#39;t scenario. I have thought it was possible from the beginning that it was a manufactured virus, I have thought it was possible from the beginning that it was intentionally released. The first hurdle is proving if what she said is true from her research, and trusting that those vetting her research are not biased/influenced/or threatened with a counter agenda. The second hurdle, well, disproving her research does not mean the CCP were not negligible nor complicit, it just means her research does not prove it. But worst of all, what happens if she is right? Do we go to war? Lets say we just do sanctions, how is that justice? Lets say we want justice, that would mean war, and given the military and resources they have gained in the last half a century, how well will that turn out for the world? How much land, resources, politicians, celebrities do they own in the west? How much corrupted tech have they sold into use in the US Military? How much access do they have in our digital infrastructure? I think the best thing to do is ween ourselves and our allies off their manufacturing industry, immediately.\n",
